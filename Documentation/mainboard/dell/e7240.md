# Dell Latitude E7240

This page is about the notebook [Dell Latitude E7240].

## Release status

Dell Latitude E7240 was released in 2013 and is now end of life.
It can be bought from a secondhand market like Taobao or eBay.

## Required proprietary blobs

The following blobs are required to operate the hardware:
1. mrc.bin
2. Intel ME firmware

Memory reference code in mrc.bin is used to initialize the Haswell platform.
You need this blob to build a working coreboot image. Please read
[mrc.bin](../../northbridge/intel/haswell/mrc.bin) for instructions on
retrieving and using it.

Intel ME firmware is in the flash chip. It is not needed when building coreboot.
It can be extracted from the OEM firmware. You can also flash only the BIOS
region to leave Intel ME firmware untouched.

## Programming

The laptop can be flashed internally under OEM firmware using [dell-flash-unlock].

To flash with an external programmer, you need to remove the battery and the base cover.
