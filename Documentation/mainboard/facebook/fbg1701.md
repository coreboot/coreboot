# Facebook FBG-1701

This page describes how to run coreboot on the Facebook FBG1701.

FBG1701 are assembled with different onboard memory modules:
	Rev 1.0	Onboard Samsung K4B8G1646D-MYKO memory
	Rev 1.1 and 1.2	Onboard Micron MT41K512M16HA-125A memory
	Rev 1.3 and 1.4 Onboard Kingston B5116ECMDXGGB memory

## Required blobs

This board currently requires:
fsp blob	3rdparty/fsp/BraswellFspBinPkg/FspBin/BSWFSP.fd
Microcode	3rdparty/intel-microcode/intel-ucode/06-4c-04

## Flashing coreboot

### Internal programming

The main SPI flash can be accessed using [flashrom].

### External programming

The system has an internal flash chip which is a 8 MiB soldered SOIC-8 chip.
This chip is located on the top middle side of the board. It's located
between SoC and Q7 connector. Use clip (or solder wires) to program
the chip.
Specifically, it's a Winbond W25Q64FW (1.8V), whose datasheet can be found
[here][W25Q64FW].

The system has an external flash chip which is a 8 MiB soldered SOIC-8 chip.
This chip is located in the middle of carrier board close to the flex cable
connection.
Specifically, it's a Winbond W25Q64FV (3.3V), whose datasheet can be found
[here][W25Q64FV].
