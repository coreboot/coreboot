# Lenovo W530 / T530

## Flashing instructions
You have to remove the keyboard and the palm rest to access one of the
flash ICs. The second flash ICs is behind the case frame, but can be
flashed by using a simple trick. Connect every pin of the first flash
IC, but tie /CS to Vcc. Connect /CS of the second flash IC to the
programmer.
As all lines except /CS are shared between the flash ICs you can access
both with an external programmer.
