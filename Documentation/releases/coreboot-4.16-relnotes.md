Upcoming release - coreboot 4.16
================================

The 4.16 release is planned for Februrary, 2022. 

We are increasing the frequency of releases in order to enable others to release quarterly on
a fresher version of coreboot.

Update this document with changes that should be in the release notes.

* Please use Markdown.
* See the past few release notes for the general format.
* The chip and board additions and removals will be updated right
  before the release, so those do not need to be added.
