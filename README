LinuxBIOS README
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LinuxBIOS is a Free Software project aimed at replacing the proprietary
BIOS you can find in most of today's computers.

It performs just a little bit of hardware initialization and then executes
one of many possible payloads, e.g. a Linux kernel.


Payloads
--------

After the basic initialization of the hardware has been performed, any
desired "payload" can be started by LinuxBIOS. Examples include:

 * A Linux kernel
 * FILO (a simple bootloader with filesystem support)
 * GRUB2 (a free bootloader; support is in development)
 * OpenBIOS (a free IEEE1275-1994 Open Firmware implementation)
 * Open Firmware (a free IEEE1275-1994 Open Firmware implementation)
 * SmartFirmware (a free IEEE1275-1994 Open Firmware implementation)
 * GNUFI (a free, UEFI-compatible firmware)
 * Etherboot (for network booting and booting from raw IDE or FILO)
 * ADLO (for booting Windows 2000 or OpenBSD)
 * Plan 9 (a distributed operating system)
 * memtest86 (for testing your RAM)


Supported Hardware
