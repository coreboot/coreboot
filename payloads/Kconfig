	help
	  Select this option if you have a payload image (a FIT file) which
	  coreboot should run as soon as the basic hardware initialization
	  is completed.

	  You will be able to specify the location and file name of the
	  payload image later.

config PAYLOAD_NONE
	bool "None"
	help
	  Select this option if you want to create an "empty" coreboot
	  ROM image for a certain mainboard, i.e. a coreboot ROM image
	  which does not yet contain a payload.

	  For such an image to be useful, you have to use 'cbfstool'
	  to add a payload to the ROM image later.

config PAYLOAD_ELF
	bool "An ELF executable payload"
	help
	  Select this option if you have a payload image (an ELF file)

	  You will be able to specify the location and file name of the
	  payload image later.
