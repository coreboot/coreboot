	help
	  Select this option if you want to create an "empty" coreboot
	  ROM image for a certain mainboard, i.e. a coreboot ROM image
	  which does not yet contain a payload.

	  For such an image to be useful, you have to use 'cbfstool'
	  to add a payload to the ROM image later.

	bool "An ELF executable payload"
	help
	  Select this option if you have a payload image (an ELF file)
	  which coreboot should run as soon as the basic hardware
	  initialization is completed.

	  You will be able to specify the location and file name of the
	  payload image later.
