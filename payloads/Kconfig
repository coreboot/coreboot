config PAYLOAD_NONE
	bool "None"
	help
	  Select this option if you want to create an "empty" coreboot
	  ROM image for a certain mainboard, i.e. a coreboot ROM image
	  which does not yet contain a payload.

	  For such an image to be useful, you have to use 'cbfstool'
	  to add a payload to the ROM image later.

config PAYLOAD_ELF
	bool "An ELF executable payload"
	help
	  Select this option if you have a payload image (an ELF file)
	  which coreboot should run as soon as the basic hardware
	  initialization is completed.

	  You will be able to specify the location and file name of the
	  payload image later.

config PAYLOAD_BAYOU
	bool "Bayou"
	help
	  Select this option if you want to set bayou as your primary
	  payload.

	  You can choose between LZMA and LZ4.

config COMPRESSED_PAYLOAD_LZMA
	bool "Use LZMA compression for payloads"
	help
	  In order to reduce the size payloads take up in the ROM chip
	  coreboot can compress them using the LZMA algorithm.

	help
	  In order to reduce the size payloads take up in the ROM chip
	  coreboot can compress them using the LZ4 algorithm.

	  elf payload

	help
	  In order to reduce the size secondary payloads take up in the

	  Stable Memtest86+ version.

	  For reproducible builds, this option must be selected.
config MEMTEST_MASTER
	bool "Master"
	help
	  Newest Memtest86+ version.

	  This option will fetch the newest version of the Memtest86+ code,
	  updating as new changes are committed.  This makes the build
	  non-reproducible, as it can fetch different code each time.
