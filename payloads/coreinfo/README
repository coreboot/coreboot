This is a silly little program that demonstrates how cool libpayload is
and also serves a purpose.  It is fun and educational!

Requirements
------------

You should use the coreboot reference cross compiler. If you insist on using
your system compiler, some Linux distributions might require you to install
a package called gcc-multilib if you are on a 64bit system.

Build
-----

You need libpayload to build coreinfo. So, first, you need follow the README of
libpayload to build it but install libpayload into its own directory by doing
this:

 $ make DESTDIR=/path/to/libpayload/install install

Then you can build coreinfo now:

 $ cd coreinfo

 $ make menuconfig

 $ make
