	  Select this option if you have a specific commit or branch

	  build SeaBIOS.

	  You will be able to specify the name of a branch or a commit id
	  later.

config SEABIOS_REVISION_ID
	string "Insert a commit's SHA-1 or a branch name"
	depends on SEABIOS_REVISION
	default "origin/master"
	help
	   The commit's SHA-1 or branch name of the revision to use.

config SEABIOS_PS2_TIMEOUT
	prompt "PS/2 keyboard controller initialization timeout (milliseconds)"
	default 0
	int
	help
	  Some PS/2 keyboard controllers don't respond to commands immediately
	  after powering on. This specifies how long SeaBIOS will wait for the
	  keyboard controller to become ready before giving up.

config SEABIOS_THREAD_OPTIONROMS
	prompt "Hardware init during option ROM execution"
	default n
	bool
	help
	  Allow hardware init to run in parallel with optionrom execution.

	  This can reduce boot time, but can cause some timing
	  variations during option ROM code execution. It is not
	  known if all option ROMs will behave properly with this option.

config SEABIOS_VGA_COREBOOT
	prompt "Include generated option rom that implements legacy VGA BIOS compatibility"
	default y if !VENDOR_EMULATION
	depends on !VGA_BIOS && MAINBOARD_DO_NATIVE_VGA_INIT
	bool
	help
	  Coreboot can initialize the GPU of some mainboards.

	  After initializing the GPU, the information about it can be passed to the payload.
	  Provide an option rom that implements this legacy VGA BIOS compatibility requirement.

config PAYLOAD_CONFIGFILE
	string "SeaBIOS config file"
	default ""
	help
	  This option allows a platform to set Kconfig options for a basic
	  SeaBIOS payload.  In general, if the option is used, the default
	  would be "$(top)/src/mainboard/$(MAINBOARDDIR)/config_seabios"

config SEABIOS_BOOTORDER_FILE
	string "SeaBIOS bootorder file"
	default ""
	help
	  Add a SeaBIOS bootorder file.  From the wiki:
	  "The bootorder file may be used to configure the boot up order. The file
	  should be ASCII text and contain one line per boot method. The description
	  of each boot method follows an Open Firmware device path format. SeaBIOS
	  will attempt to boot from each item in the file - first line of the file
	  first."

	  See: https://www.coreboot.org/SeaBIOS#Configuring_boot_order

	  If used, a typical value would be:
	    $(top)/src/mainboard/$(MAINBOARDDIR)/bootorder
