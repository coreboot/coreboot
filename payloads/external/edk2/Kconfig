	  Select this option to enable Above 4G Decode. This will allow the

	  Disabling memory above 4G is useful for bootloaders that are not

	default "Documentation/coreboot_logo.bmp"
	help
	  The path and filename of the file to use as graphical bootsplash
	  image. If this option is not configured, the default
	  coreboot logo (European Brown Hare) will used.

	  You can use any image format supported by imagemagick, a list of which
	  can be found [here](https://imagemagick.org/script/formats.php).

	  The build process will automatically convert this to the format that
	  edk2 requires, which is an uncompressed BMP, in BMP3 format. It does
	  this using imagemagick (`convert splosh.bmp BMP3:splash.bmp`).

	  The newly formatted file will be the dimensions size as the original
	  one.

	  The build process will automatically do this conversion, so it can
	  be supplied with any format that imagemagick can process (which is
	  pretty much any!).

	  This image will also be used as the BGRT boot image, which may
	  persist through your OS boot process.

	  See ACPI spec 6.3, 5.2.22 Boot Graphics Resource Table (BGRT), and
	  Microsoft's documentation on BGRT positioning:
	  Docs/Windows/Windows Drivers/Bring up guide/Boot screen components

	  Accordingly, the image used should be no taller/wider than 40% of
	  the display panel's native pixel height/width (or resolution set).

	  If an absolute path is not given, the path will assumed to be
	  relative to the coreboot root directory.

config EDK2_CBMEM_LOGGING
	bool "Enable edk2 logging to CBMEM"
	help
	  Select this option if you want to enable edk2 logging to CBMEM.
	  You may want to increase the default cbmem buffer size when selecting

	  This option can support both macros `-D` and Pcds `--pcd`.
