config PXE_ROM_ID
	string "network card PCI IDs"

	help
	  The comma-separated PCI vendor and device ID that would associate
	  your PXE ROM to your network card.

	  Example: 10ec,8168

	  In the above example 10ec is the PCI vendor ID (in hex, but without
	  the "0x" prefix) and 8168 specifies the PCI device ID of the
	  network card (also in hex, without "0x" prefix).

	  Under GNU/Linux you can run `lspci -nn` to list the IDs of your PCI devices.

config PXE_SERIAL_CONSOLE

	help
	  Enable/disable iPXE serial console. Since SeaBIOS supports serial
	  console this option might be helpful to avoid duplicated output.

	  Unselect to let only SeaBIOS handle printing output.
