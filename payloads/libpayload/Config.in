config TINYCURSES
	bool "Tinycurses"
	help
	  Tinycurses was the first curses implementation for libpayload.
	  It features low memory consumption, static allocation of larger
	  data structures (so few or no memory allocation calls) and a
	  reduced feature set.

config PDCURSES
	bool "PDCurses"
	help
	  libpayload's PDCurses port provides a full features curses
	  implementation, including libpanel, libmenu and libform (which
	  are taken from ncurses).
	  It requires more system resources, in particularily heap memory.

menu "Console Options"

config SKIP_CONSOLE_INIT
	bool "Skip initializing the consoles at startup"
	default n
	help
	  Normally, libpayload will initialize console input/output on startup
	  before the payload itself gets control. This option disables that
	  behavior and leaves console initialization up to the payload.

config SERIAL_ACS_FALLBACK
	bool "Use plain ASCII characters for ACS"
	default n
	depends on SERIAL_CONSOLE
	help
	  The alternate character set (ACS) is used for drawing lines and
	  displaying a couple of other special graphics characters.  The
	  ACS characters generally look good on screen, but can be difficult
	  to cut and paste from a terminal window to a text editor.

	  Say 'y' here if you want to always use plain ASCII characters to
	  approximate the appearance of ACS characters on the serial port
	  console.

config RTC_PORT_EXTENDED_VIA
	bool "Extended RTC ports are 0x74/0x75"
	default n
	help
	  For recent chipsets with 256 NVRAM bytes, you have to access the
	  upper 128 bytes (128-255) using two different I/O ports,
	  usually 0x72/0x73.

	  On some chipsets this can be a different set of ports, though.
	  The VIA VT8237R for example only recognizes the ports 0x74/0x75
	  for accessing the high 128 NVRAM bytes (as seems to be the case for
	  multiple VIA chipsets).

	  If you want to read or write CMOS bytes on computers with one of
	  these chipsets, say 'y' here.

	  Select this option if you want to use devices complying to the
	  USB HID (Human Interface Device) standard. Such devices are for
	  example keyboards and mice. Currently only keyboards are supported.
