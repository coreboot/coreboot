	  For recent chipsets with 256 NVRAM bytes, you have to access the
	  upper 128 bytes (128-255) using two different I/O ports,
	  usually 0x72/0x73.
	
	  On some chipsets this can be a different set of ports, though.
	  The VIA VT8237R for example only recognizes the ports 0x74/0x75
	  for accessing the high 128 NVRAM bytes (as seems to be the case for
	  multiple VIA chipsets).
	
	  If you want to read or write CMOS bytes on computers with one of
	  these chipsets, say 'y' here.
