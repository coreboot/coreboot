libpayload README
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

libpayload is a minimal library to support standalone payloads
that can be booted with firmware like coreboot. It handles the setup
code, and provides common C library symbols such as malloc() and printf().

Note: This is _not_ a standard library for use with an operating system,
rather it's only useful for coreboot payload development!
See http://coreboot.org for details on coreboot.


Installation
------------

 $ git clone http://review.coreboot.org/p/coreboot.git

 $ cd payloads/libpayload

 $ make menuconfig

 $ make

 $ sudo make install (optional, will install into /opt per default)

As libpayload is for 32bit x86 systems only, you might have to install the
32bit libgcc version, otherwise your payloads will fail to compile.
On Debian systems you'd do 'apt-get install gcc-multilib' for example.


Usage
-----

Here's an example of a very simple payload (hello.c) and how to build it:

 #include <libpayload.h>

 int main(void)
 {
     printf("Hello, world!\n");
     return 0;
 }

Building the payload using the 'lpgcc' compiler wrapper:

 $ lpgcc -o hello.elf hello.c

Please see the sample/ directory for details.
