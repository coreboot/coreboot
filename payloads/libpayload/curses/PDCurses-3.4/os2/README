PDCurses for OS/2
=================

This directory contains PDCurses source code files specific to OS/2.


Building
--------

. Choose the appropriate makefile for your compiler:

	bccos2.mak	- Borland C++ 2.0
	gccos2.mak	- EMX 0.9b+
	iccos2.mak	- C Set/2
	wccos2.mak	- Watcom 10.6+ (32-bit)

. Optionally, you can build in a different directory than the platform
  directory by setting PDCURSES_SRCDIR to point to the directory where
  you unpacked PDCurses, and changing to your target directory:

	set PDCURSES_SRCDIR=c:\pdcurses

. Build it:

	make -f makefilename

  (For Watcom, use "wmake" instead of "make"; for MSVC or C Set/2,
  "nmake".) You'll get the libraries (pdcurses.lib or .a, depending on
  your compiler; and panel.lib or .a), the demos (*.exe), and a lot of
  object files. Note that the panel library is just a copy of the main
  library, provided for convenience; both panel and curses functions are
  in the main library.

  You can also use the optional parameter "DLL=Y" with EMX, to build the 
  library as a DLL:

	make -f gccos2.mak DLL=Y
