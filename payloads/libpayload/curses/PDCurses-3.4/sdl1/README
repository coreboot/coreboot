PDCurses for SDL
================

This is a port of PDCurses for SDL.


Building
--------

. On *nix (including Linux and Mac OS X), run "make" in the sdl1
  directory. There is no configure script (yet?) for this port. This
  assumes a working sdl-config, and GNU make. It builds the library 
  libpdcurses.a (dynamic lib not implemented).

  With MinGW, run "make -f Makefile.mng". This assumes SDL is installed
  in the standard directories. The MinGW makefile accepts the optional
  parameters "DLL=Y" and "DEBUG=Y", as with the console version. (Wide-
  character support is not yet implemented for SDL.) Both makefiles
  recognize the optional PDCURSES_SRCDIR environment variable, as with
  the console ports. Makefile.mng builds libpdcurses.a, along with 
  pdcurses.dll, if specified.
