config COREBOOT_BUILD
	bool
	default y

config LOCALVERSION
	string "Local version string"
	help
	  Append an extra string to the end of the coreboot version.

	  This can be useful if, for instance, you want to append the
	  respective board's hostname or some other identifying string to
	  the coreboot version number, so that you can easily distinguish
	  boot logs of different boards from each other.

config CBFS_PREFIX
	string "CBFS prefix to use"
	default "fallback"
	help
	  Select the prefix to all files put into the image. It's "fallback"
	  by default, "normal" is a common alternative.

choice
	prompt "Compiler to use"
	default COMPILER_GCC
	help
	  This option allows you to select the compiler used for building
	  coreboot.
	  You must build the coreboot crosscompiler for the board that you
	  have selected.

	  To build all the GCC crosscompilers (takes a LONG time), run:
	    make crossgcc

	  For help on individual architectures, run the command:
	    make help_toolchain

config COMPILER_GCC
	bool "GCC"
	help
	  Use the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) to build coreboot.

	  For details see http://gcc.gnu.org.

config COMPILER_LLVM_CLANG
	bool "LLVM/clang (TESTING ONLY - Not currently working)"
	help
	  Use LLVM/clang to build coreboot.  To use this, you must build the
	  coreboot version of the clang compiler.  Run the command
	    make clang
	  Note that this option is not currently working correctly and should
	  really only be selected if you're trying to work on getting clang
	  operational.

	  For details see http://clang.llvm.org.

endchoice

config ANY_TOOLCHAIN
	bool "Allow building with any toolchain"
	default n
	help
	  Many toolchains break when building coreboot since it uses quite
	  unusual linker features. Unless developers explicitely request it,
	  we'll have to assume that they use their distro compiler by mistake.
	  Make sure that using patched compilers is a conscious decision.

config CCACHE
	bool "Use ccache to speed up (re)compilation"
	default n
	help
	  Enables the use of ccache for faster builds.

	  Requires the ccache utility in your system $PATH.

	  For details see https://ccache.samba.org.

config FMD_GENPARSER
	bool "Generate flashmap descriptor parser using flex and bison"
	default n
	help
	  Enable this option if you are working on the flashmap descriptor
	  parser and made changes to fmd_scanner.l or fmd_parser.y.

	  Otherwise, say N to use the provided pregenerated scanner/parser.

config UTIL_GENPARSER
	bool "Generate SCONFIG & BINCFG parser using flex and bison"
	default n
	help
	  Enable this option if you are working on the sconfig device tree
	  parser or bincfg and made changes to the .l or .y files.

	  Otherwise, say N to use the provided pregenerated scanner/parser.

config USE_OPTION_TABLE
	bool "Use CMOS for configuration values"
	depends on HAVE_OPTION_TABLE
	help
	  Enable this option if coreboot shall read options from the "CMOS"
	  NVRAM instead of using hard-coded values.

config STATIC_OPTION_TABLE
	bool "Load default configuration values into CMOS on each boot"
	depends on USE_OPTION_TABLE
	help
	  Enable this option to reset "CMOS" NVRAM values to default on
	  every boot.  Use this if you want the NVRAM configuration to
	  never be modified from its default values.

config COMPRESS_RAMSTAGE
	bool "Compress ramstage with LZMA"
	# Default value set at the end of the file
	help
	  Compress ramstage to save memory in the flash image. Note
	  that decompression might slow down booting if the boot flash
	  is connected through a slow link (i.e. SPI).

config COMPRESS_PRERAM_STAGES
	bool "Compress romstage and verstage with LZ4"
	depends on !ARCH_X86
	# Default value set at the end of the file
	help
	  Compress romstage and (if it exists) verstage with LZ4 to save flash
	  space and speed up boot, since the time for reading the image from SPI
	  (and in the vboot case verifying it) is usually much greater than the
	  time spent decompressing. Doesn't work for XIP stages (assume all
	  ARCH_X86 for now) for obvious reasons.

config COMPRESS_BOOTBLOCK
	bool
	help
	  This option can be used to compress the bootblock with LZ4 and attach
	  a small self-decompression stub to its front. This can drastically
	  reduce boot time on platforms where the bootblock is loaded over a
	  very slow connection and bootblock size trumps all other factors for
	  speed. Since this using this option usually requires changes to the
	  SoC memlayout and possibly extra support code, it should not be
	  user-selectable. (There's no real point in offering this to the user
	  anyway... if it works and saves boot time, you would always want it.)

config INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILE
	bool "Include the coreboot .config file into the ROM image"
	# Default value set at the end of the file
	help
	  Include the .config file that was used to compile coreboot
	  in the (CBFS) ROM image. This is useful if you want to know which
	  options were used to build a specific coreboot.rom image.

	  Saying Y here will increase the image size by 2-3KB.

	  You can use the following command to easily list the options:

	    grep -a CONFIG_ coreboot.rom

	  Alternatively, you can also use cbfstool to print the image
	  contents (including the raw 'config' item we're looking for).

	  Example:

	    $ cbfstool coreboot.rom print
	    coreboot.rom: 4096 kB, bootblocksize 1008, romsize 4194304,
	                                               offset 0x0
	    Alignment: 64 bytes

	    Name                           Offset     Type         Size
	    cmos_layout.bin                0x0        cmos layout  1159
	    fallback/romstage              0x4c0      stage        339756
	    fallback/ramstage              0x53440    stage        186664
	    fallback/payload               0x80dc0    payload      51526
	    config                         0x8d740    raw          3324
	    (empty)                        0x8e480    null         3610440

config COLLECT_TIMESTAMPS
	bool "Create a table of timestamps collected during boot"
	default y if ARCH_X86
	help
	  Make coreboot create a table of timer-ID/timer-value pairs to
	  allow measuring time spent at different phases of the boot process.

config TIMESTAMPS_ON_CONSOLE
	bool "Print the timestamp values on the console"
	default n
	depends on COLLECT_TIMESTAMPS
	help
	  Print the timestamps to the debug console if enabled at level spew.

config USE_BLOBS
	bool "Allow use of binary-only repository"
	help
	  This draws in the blobs repository, which contains binary files that
	  might be required for some chipsets or boards.
	  This flag ensures that a "Free" option remains available for users.

config COVERAGE
	bool "Code coverage support"
	depends on COMPILER_GCC
	help
	  Add code coverage support for coreboot. This will store code
	  coverage information in CBMEM for extraction from user space.
	  If unsure, say N.

config UBSAN
	bool "Undefined behavior sanitizer support"
	default n
	help
	  Instrument the code with checks for undefined behavior. If unsure,
	  say N because it adds a small performance penalty and may abort
	  on code that happens to work in spite of the UB.

config RELOCATABLE_RAMSTAGE
	depends on EARLY_CBMEM_INIT
	bool "Build the ramstage to be relocatable in 32-bit address space."
	select RELOCATABLE_MODULES
	help
	 The reloctable ramstage support allows for the ramstage to be built
	 as a relocatable module. The stage loader can identify a place
	 out of the OS way so that copying memory is unnecessary during an S3
	 wake. When selecting this option the romstage is responsible for
	 determing a stack location to use for loading the ramstage.

config CACHE_RELOCATED_RAMSTAGE_OUTSIDE_CBMEM
	depends on RELOCATABLE_RAMSTAGE
	bool
	help
	 The relocated ramstage is saved in an area specified by the
	 by the board and/or chipset.

config UPDATE_IMAGE
	bool "Update existing coreboot.rom image"
	help
	  If this option is enabled, no new coreboot.rom file
	  is created. Instead it is expected that there already
	  is a suitable file for further processing.
	  The bootblock will not be modified.

	  If unsure, select 'N'

config BOOTSPLASH_IMAGE
	bool "Add a bootsplash image"
	help
	  Select this option if you have a bootsplash image that you would
	  like to add to your ROM.

	  This will only add the image to the ROM. To actually run it check
	  options under 'Display' section.

config BOOTSPLASH_FILE
	string "Bootsplash path and filename"
	depends on BOOTSPLASH_IMAGE
	# Default value set at the end of the file
	help
	  The path and filename of the file to use as graphical bootsplash
	  screen. The file format has to be jpg.

config DEVICETREE
	string
	default "devicetree.cb"
	help
	  This symbol allows mainboards to select a different file under their
	  mainboard directory for the devicetree.cb file.  This allows the board
	  variants that need different devicetrees to be in the same directory.

	  Examples: "devicetree.variant.cb"
	            "variant/devicetree.cb"

config CBFS_SIZE
	hex "Size of CBFS filesystem in ROM"
	# Default value set at the end of the file
	help
	  This is the part of the ROM actually managed by CBFS, located at the
	  end of the ROM (passed through cbfstool -o) on x86 and at at the start
	  of the ROM (passed through cbfstool -s) everywhere else. It defaults
	  to span the whole ROM on all but Intel systems that use an Intel Firmware
	  Descriptor.  It can be overridden to make coreboot live alongside other
	  components like ChromeOS's vboot/FMAP or Intel's IFD / ME / TXE
	  binaries.

config FMDFILE
	string "fmap description file in fmd format"
	default "src/mainboard/$(CONFIG_MAINBOARD_DIR)/chromeos.fmd" if CHROMEOS
	default ""
	help
	  The build system creates a default FMAP from ROM_SIZE and CBFS_SIZE,
	  but in some cases more complex setups are required.
	  When an fmd is specified, it overrides the default format.
