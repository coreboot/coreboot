config LOCALVERSION
	string "Local version string"
	help
	  Append an extra string to the end of the coreboot version.

	  This can be useful if, for instance, you want to append the
	  respective board's hostname or some other identifying string to
	  the coreboot version number, so that you can easily distinguish
	  boot logs of different boards from each other.

config CBFS_PREFIX
	string "CBFS prefix to use"
	default "fallback"
	help
	  Select the prefix to all files put into the image. It's "fallback"
	  by default, "normal" is a common alternative.

config COMMON_CBFS_SPI_WRAPPER

	default n
	depends on SPI_FLASH
	depends on !ARCH_X86
	help
	 Use common wrapper to interface CBFS to SPI bootrom.

config MULTIPLE_CBFS_INSTANCES
	bool "Multiple CBFS instances in the bootrom"
	default n
	help
	  Account for the firmware image containing more than one CBFS
	  instance. Locations of instances are known at build time and are
	  communicated between coreboot stages to make sure the next stage is
	  loaded from the appropriate instance.

choice
	prompt "Compiler to use"
	default COMPILER_GCC
	help
	  This option allows you to select the compiler used for building
	  coreboot.

config COMPILER_GCC
	bool "GCC"
	help
	  Use the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) to build coreboot.

	  For details see http://gcc.gnu.org.

config COMPILER_LLVM_CLANG

config ANY_TOOLCHAIN
	bool "Allow building with any toolchain"
	default n
	depends on COMPILER_GCC
	help
	  Many toolchains break when building coreboot since it uses quite
	  unusual linker features. Unless developers explicitely request it,
	  we'll have to assume that they use their distro compiler by mistake.
	  Make sure that using patched compilers is a conscious decision.

config CCACHE
	bool "Use ccache to speed up (re)compilation"
	default n
	help
	  Enables the use of ccache for faster builds.

	  Requires the ccache utility in your system $PATH.

	  NVRAM instead of using hard-coded values.

config STATIC_OPTION_TABLE
	bool "Load default configuration values into CMOS on each boot"
	default n
	depends on USE_OPTION_TABLE
	help
	  Enable this option to reset "CMOS" NVRAM values to default on

config COMPRESS_RAMSTAGE
	bool "Compress ramstage with LZMA"
	default y if !UNCOMPRESSED_RAMSTAGE
	default n
	help
	  Compress ramstage to save memory in the flash image. Note
	  that decompression might slow down booting if the boot flash
	  is connected through a slow link (i.e. SPI).

config INCLUDE_CONFIG_FILE
	bool "Include the coreboot .config file into the ROM image"
	default y
	help
	  Include the .config file that was used to compile coreboot
	  in the (CBFS) ROM image. This is useful if you want to know which
	  options were used to build a specific coreboot.rom image.

	  Saying Y here will increase the image size by 2-3KB.

	  You can use the following command to easily list the options:

	    grep -a CONFIG_ coreboot.rom

	  Alternatively, you can also use cbfstool to print the image
	  contents (including the raw 'config' item we're looking for).

	  Example:

	    $ cbfstool coreboot.rom print
	    coreboot.rom: 4096 kB, bootblocksize 1008, romsize 4194304,
	                                               offset 0x0

	  stage boundaries.

config USE_BLOBS
	bool "Allow use of binary-only repository"
	default n
	help
	  This draws in the blobs repository, which contains binary files that

	bool "Build the ramstage to be relocatable in 32-bit address space."
	default n
	select RELOCATABLE_MODULES
	help
	 The reloctable ramstage support allows for the ramstage to be built
	 as a relocatable module. The stage loader can identify a place
	 out of the OS way so that copying memory is unnecessary during an S3
	 wake. When selecting this option the romstage is responsible for
	 determing a stack location to use for loading the ramstage.

config CACHE_RELOCATED_RAMSTAGE_OUTSIDE_CBMEM

	  The bootblock will not be modified.

config GENERIC_GPIO_LIB

	  reading board straps) and stores it in coreboot table.

config BOOTSPLASH_IMAGE
	bool "Add a bootsplash image"
	help
	  Select this option if you have a bootsplash image that you would
