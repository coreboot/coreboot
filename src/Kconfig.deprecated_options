# It might be possible to consolidate hard_reset() to southbridges,
# given that it (usually) uses its registers.
# The long term goal would be to eliminate hard_reset() from boards.
config BOARD_HAS_HARD_RESET
	bool
	default n
	help
	  This variable specifies whether a given board has a reset.c
	  file containing a hard_reset() function.

# It might be possible to consolidate FADTs to southbridges. This would
# improve code reuse in the tree.
config BOARD_HAS_FADT
	bool
	default n
	help
	  This variable specifies whether a given board has a board-local
	  FADT in fadt.c. Long-term, those should be moved to appropriate
	  chipset components (eg. southbridge).

# Will be removed (alongside with the PS/2 init code) once payloads
# reliably support PS/2 init themselves.
config DRIVERS_PS2_KEYBOARD
	bool "PS/2 keyboard init"
	default y
	help
	  Enable this option to initialize PS/2 keyboards found connected
	  to the PS/2 port.

	  Some payloads (eg, filo) require this option.  Other payloads
	  (eg, SeaBIOS, Linux) do not require it.
	  Initializing a PS/2 keyboard can take several hundred milliseconds.

	  If you know you will only use a payload which does not require
	  this option, then you can say N here to speed up boot time.
	  Otherwise say Y.

# This was a config option for a long time, but it never showed up in Kconfig.
# It should go away and "tuning" should always be enabled when PCIe is there,
# or it should be more fine grained (ie. Enable PCIe ASPM)
config PCIE_TUNING
	bool
	default n
	help
	  This variable enables certain PCIe optimizations. Right now it's
	  only ASPM and it's untested.

config ID_SECTION_OFFSET
	hex
	default 0x80
