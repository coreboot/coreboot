/*
 * This is the original bootblock used by coreboot on x86 systems. It contains
 * a monolithic code flow, assembled from the following stages:
 *     - reset16.inc: the reset vector
 *     - entry16.inc: protected mode setup
 *     - entry32.inc: segment descriptor setup
 *     - timestamp.inc: store TSC in MMX registers
 *     - generated/bootblock.inc: ROMCC part of the bootblock
 *
 * This is used on platforms which select ROMCC_BOOTBLOCK, and it
 * tries to do the absolute minimum before walking CBFS and jumping to romstage.
 *
 * This file assembles the bootblock program by the order of the includes. Thus,
 * it's extremely important that one pays very careful attention to the order
 * of the includes.
