config CPU_MICROCODE_CBFS_GENERATE
	bool "Generate from tree"
	help
	  Select this option if you want microcode updates to be assembled when
	  building coreboot and included in the final image as a separate CBFS
	  file. Microcode will not be hard-coded into ramstage.

	  The microcode file may be removed from the ROM image at a later
	  time with cbfstool, if desired.

	  If unsure, select this option.

config CPU_MICROCODE_CBFS_EXTERNAL
	bool "Include external microcode file"
	help
	  Select this option if you want to include an external file containing
	  the CPU microcode. This will be included as a separate file in CBFS.
	  A word of caution: only select this option if you are sure the
	  microcode that you have is newer than the microcode shipping with
	  coreboot.

	  The microcode file may be removed from the ROM image at a later
	  time with cbfstool, if desired.

	  If unsure, select "Generate from tree"

config CPU_MICROCODE_CBFS_NONE
	bool "Do not include microcode updates"
	help
	  Select this option if you do not want CPU microcode included in CBFS.
	  Note that for some CPUs, the microcode is hard-coded into the source
	  tree and is not loaded from CBFS. In this case, microcode will still
	  be updated. There is a push to move all microcode to CBFS, but this
	  change is not implemented for all CPUs.

	  This option currently applies to:
	    - Intel SandyBridge/IvyBridge
	    - VIA Nano

	  Microcode may be added to the ROM image at a later time with cbfstool,
	  if desired.

	  If unsure, select "Generate from tree"

	  The GOOD:
	  Microcode updates intend to solve issues that have been discovered
	  after CPU production. The expected effect is that systems work as
	  intended with the updated microcode, but we have also seen cases where
	  issues were solved by not applying microcode updates.

	  The BAD:
	  Note that some operating system include these same microcode patches,
	  so you may need to also disable microcode updates in your operating
	  system for this option to have an effect.

	  The UGLY:
	  A word of CAUTION: some CPUs depend on microcode updates to function
	  correctly. Not updating the microcode may leave the CPU operating at
	  less than optimal performance, or may cause outright hangups.
	  There are CPUs where coreboot cannot properly initialize the CPU
	  without microcode updates
	  For example, if running with the factory microcode, some Intel
	  SandyBridge CPUs may hang when enabling CAR, or some VIA Nano CPUs
	  will hang when changing the frequency.

	  Make sure you have a way of flashing the ROM externally before
	  selecting this option.
