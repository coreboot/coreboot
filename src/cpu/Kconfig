	  Select MMX in your socket or model Kconfig if your CPU has MMX
	  streaming SIMD instructions. ROMCC can build more efficient
	  code if it can spill to MMX registers.

config SSE

	help
	  Select SSE in your socket or model Kconfig if your CPU has SSE
	  streaming SIMD instructions. ROMCC can build more efficient
	  code if it can spill to SSE (aka XMM) registers.

config SSE2
	bool
	default n
	help
	  Select SSE2 in your socket or model Kconfig if your CPU has SSE2
	  streaming SIMD instructions. Some parts of coreboot can be built
	  with more efficient code if SSE2 instructions are available.

	  Select this to apply patches to the CPU microcode provided by the
	  vendor (without source), and distributed with coreboot, to address
	  issues in the CPU post production.

	  Microcode updates distributed with coreboot are not necessarily the
	  latest version available. Updates are only applied if they are newer
	  than the microcode already in the CPU.

	  Unselect this to let CPUs run with microcode as shipped from factory.
	  No binary microcode patches will be included in the coreboot image in
	  that case, which can help with creating an image for which complete
	  source code is available, which in turn might simplify license
	  compliance.

	  Microcode updates intend to solve issues that have been discovered
	  after CPU production. The common case is that systems work as intended
	  with updated microcode, but we have also seen cases where issues were
	  solved by not applying the microcode updates.

	  Note that some operating system include these same microcode patches,
	  so you may need to also disable microcode updates in your operating
	  system in order for this option to matter.
