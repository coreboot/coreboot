	  This option is used to enable certain functions to make coreboot
	  work correctly on symmetric multi processor (SMP) systems.

	  This must equal address of ap_sipi_vector from bootblock build.

config	MMX
	bool
	help
	  Select MMX in your socket or model Kconfig if your CPU has MMX
	  streaming SIMD instructions. ROMCC can build more efficient
	  code if it can spill to MMX registers.

config SSE
	bool
	help
	  Select SSE in your socket or model Kconfig if your CPU has SSE
	  streaming SIMD instructions. ROMCC can build more efficient
	  code if it can spill to SSE (aka XMM) registers.

config SSE2
	bool
	default n
	help
	  Select SSE2 in your socket or model Kconfig if your CPU has SSE2
	  streaming SIMD instructions. Some parts of coreboot can be built
	  with more efficient code if SSE2 instructions are available.

	  Select this option if you want microcode updates to be assembled when
	  building coreboot and included in the final image as a separate CBFS
	  file. Microcode will not be hard-coded into ramstage, and may be
	  removed from the ROM image at a later time with cbfstool.

	depends on CPU_MICROCODE_IN_CBFS
	bool "Include external microcode file"
	help
	  Select this option if you want to include an external file containing
	  the CPU microcode. This will be included as a separate file in CBFS.
	  A word of caution: only select this option if you are sure the
	  microcode that you have is newer than the microcode shipping with
	  coreboot.

	    The path and filename of the file containing the CPU microcode.

config CPU_MICROCODE_CBFS_NONE
	bool "Do not include microcode updates"
	help
	  Select this option if you do not want CPU microcode included in CBFS.
	  Note that for some CPUs, the microcode is hard-coded into the source
	  tree and is not loaded from CBFS. In this case, microcode will still
	  be updated.
