	  This option is used to enable certain functions to make coreboot

	  This must equal address of ap_sipi_vector from bootblock build.

config	MMX
	bool

	  Select MMX in your socket or model Kconfig if your CPU has MMX
	  streaming SIMD instructions. ROMCC can build more efficient
	  code if it can spill to MMX registers.

config SSE
	bool
	help
	  Select SSE in your socket or model Kconfig if your CPU has SSE
	  streaming SIMD instructions. ROMCC can build more efficient
	  code if it can spill to SSE (aka XMM) registers.

config SSE2
	bool
	default n
	select SSE
	help
	  Select SSE2 in your socket or model Kconfig if your CPU has SSE2
	  streaming SIMD instructions. Some parts of coreboot can be built
	  with more efficient code if SSE2 instructions are available.

config CPU_MICROCODE_CBFS_GENERATE
	bool "Generate from tree"
	help
	  Select this option if you want microcode updates to be assembled when
	  building coreboot and included in the final image as a separate CBFS
	  file. Microcode will not be hard-coded into ramstage.

	  The microcode file may be removed from the ROM image at a later
	  time with cbfstool, if desired.

	  If unsure, select this option.

config CPU_MICROCODE_CBFS_EXTERNAL_HEADER
	bool "Include external microcode header files"
	help
	  Select this option if you want to include external c header files
	  containing the CPU microcode. This will be included as a separate
	  file in CBFS.

	  A word of caution: only select this option if you are sure the
	  microcode that you have is newer than the microcode shipping with
	  coreboot.

	  The microcode file may be removed from the ROM image at a later
	  time with cbfstool, if desired.

	  If unsure, select "Generate from tree"

config CPU_MICROCODE_CBFS_NONE
	bool "Do not include microcode updates"
	help
	  Select this option if you do not want CPU microcode included in CBFS.
	  Note that for some CPUs, the microcode is hard-coded into the source
	  tree and is not loaded from CBFS. In this case, microcode will still
	  be updated. There is a push to move all microcode to CBFS, but this
	  change is not implemented for all CPUs.

	  This option currently applies to:
	    - Intel SandyBridge/IvyBridge
	    - VIA Nano

	  Microcode may be added to the ROM image at a later time with cbfstool,
	  if desired.

	  If unsure, select "Generate from tree"

	  The GOOD:
	  Microcode updates intend to solve issues that have been discovered
	  after CPU production. The expected effect is that systems work as
	  intended with the updated microcode, but we have also seen cases where
	  issues were solved by not applying microcode updates.

	  The BAD:
	  Note that some operating system include these same microcode patches,
	  so you may need to also disable microcode updates in your operating
	  system for this option to have an effect.

	  The UGLY:
	  A word of CAUTION: some CPUs depend on microcode updates to function
	  correctly. Not updating the microcode may leave the CPU operating at
	  less than optimal performance, or may cause outright hangups.
	  There are CPUs where coreboot cannot properly initialize the CPU
	  without microcode updates
	  For example, if running with the factory microcode, some Intel
	  SandyBridge CPUs may hang when enabling CAR, or some VIA Nano CPUs
	  will hang when changing the frequency.

	  Make sure you have a way of flashing the ROM externally before
	  selecting this option.

config CPU_MICROCODE_HEADER_FILES
	string "List of space separated microcode header files with the path"

	  A list of one or more microcode header files with path from the

	help
	  Some platforms have microcode in the blobs directory, and these can
	  be hardcoded in the makefiles.  For platforms with microcode
	  binaries that aren't in the makefile, set this option to pull
	  in the microcode.

	  This should contain the full path of the file for one or more
	  microcode binary files to include, separated by spaces.

	  If unsure, leave this blank.
