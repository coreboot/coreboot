/**
 * \brief Configure PLL5 factors
 *
 * This is a low-level accessor to configure the divisors and multipliers of
 * PLL5. PLL5 uses two factors to multiply the 24MHz oscillator clock to
 * generate a pre-clock. The pre-divided clock is then divided by one of two
 * independent divisors, one for DRAM, and another for peripherals clocked from
 * this PLL. If the PLL was previously disabled, this function will enable it.
 * Other than that, this function only modifies these factors, and leaves the
 * other settings unchanged.
 *
 * The output clocks are given by the following formulas:
 *
 * Pre-clock    = (24 MHz * N * K) <- Must be between 240MHz and 2GHz
 * DRAM clock   = pre / M
 * Other module = pre / P
 *
 * It is the caller's responsibility to make sure the pre-divided clock falls
 * within the operational range of the PLL, and that the divisors and
 * multipliers are within their ranges.
 *
 * @param[in] mul_n Multiplier N, between 0 and 32
 * @param[in] mul_k Multiplier K, between 1 and 4
 * @param[in] div_m DRAM clock divisor, between 1 and 4
 * @param[in] exp_div_p Peripheral clock divisor exponent, between 0 and 3
 *			(P = 1/2/4/8, respectively)
