	  Overwride the default write through caching size as 1M Bytes.
	  On some AMD paltform, one socket support 2 or more kinds of
	  processor family, compiling several cpu families agesa code
	  will increase the romstage size.
	  In order to execute romstage in place on the flash rom,
	  more space is required to be set as write through caching.
