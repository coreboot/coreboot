	  Select this to apply patches to the CPU microcode provided by
	  AMD without source, and distributed with coreboot, to address
	  issues in the CPU post production.

	  Microcode updates distributed with coreboot are not necessarily
	  the latest version available from AMD. Updates are only applied
	  if they are newer than the microcode already in your CPU.

	  Unselect this to let Fam10h CPUs run with microcode as shipped
	  from factory. No binary microcode patches will be included in the
	  coreboot image in that case, which can help with creating an image
	  for which complete source code is available, which in turn might
	  simplify license compliance.

	  Microcode updates intend to solve issues that have been discovered
	  after CPU production. The common case is that systems work as
	  intended with updated microcode, but we have also seen cases where
	  issues were solved by not applying the microcode updates.

	  Note that some operating system include these same microcode
	  patches, so you may need to also disable microcode updates in
	  your operating system in order for this option to matter.
