	  Although the Intel manual says you must set the lock bit in addition
	  to the VMX bit in order for VMX to work, this isn't strictly true, so
	  we have the option to leave it unlocked and allow the OS (e.g. Linux)
	  to manage things itself. This is beneficial for testing purposes as
	  there is no need to reflash the firmware just to toggle the lock bit.
	  However, leaving the lock bit unset will break Windows' detection of
	  VMX support and built-in virtualization features like Hyper-V.

config SET_MSR_AESNI_LOCK_BIT

	  This config sets the AES-NI lock bit, if available, to prevent any
	  further change of AES-NI enablement. This may be disabled for e.g.
	  testing or debugging.
