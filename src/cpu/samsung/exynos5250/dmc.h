/* For reasons unknown, people are in the habit of taking a 32-bit
 * field with 2 possible values and packing it with, say, 2 bits. A
 * non-robust encoding, using only 2 bits of a 32-bit field, is
 * incredibly difficult to deal with when things go wrong, because
 * there are a lot of things that get expressed as 0, 1, or 2. If
 * you're scanning with jtag or dumping memory it is really hard to
 * tell when you've hit the beginning of the struct. So, let's be a
 * bit smart here. First, while it's common to let the enum count
 * entries for you, when there are two of them, we can do the
 * counting. And, let's set the values to something we can easily scan
 * for in memory. Since '1' and '2' are rather common, we pick
 * something that's actually of some value when things go wrong.  This
 * setup motivated by a use case: something's going wrong and having a
 * manuf name of '1' or '2' is completely useless!
