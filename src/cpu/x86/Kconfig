	 This option uses common MP infrastructure for bringing up APs

	  This option limits the number of SIPI signals sent during during the

	  sequence, however this doesn't work on some AMD and Intel platforms.
	  These newer AMD and Intel platforms don't need the 10ms wait between

	  This option allows a platform to reserve 2 MTRRs for the OS usage.
	  The Intel SDM documents that the the first 6 MTRRs are intended for
	  the system BIOS and the last 2 are to be reserved for OS usage.
	  However, modern OSes use PAT to control cacheability instead of
	  using MTRRs.

config CPU_INFO_V2

	help
	  Enables the new method of locating struct cpu_info. This new method
	  uses the %gs segment to locate the cpu_info pointer. The old method
	  relied on the stack being CONFIG_STACK_SIZE aligned.
