config PARALLEL_MP
	def_bool y
	help
	 This option uses common MP infrastructure for bringing up APs
	 in parallel. It additionally provides a more flexible mechanism
	 for sequencing the steps of bringing up the APs.
	 The code also works for just initialising the BSP in case there
	 are no APs.

config PARALLEL_MP_AP_WORK
	def_bool n
	depends on PARALLEL_MP
	help
	 Allow APs to do other work after initialization instead of going
	 to sleep.

config X86_SMM_SKIP_RELOCATION_HANDLER
	bool
	default n
	depends on PARALLEL_MP && HAVE_SMI_HANDLER
	help
	  Skip SMM relocation using a relocation handler running in SMM
	  with a stub at 0x30000. This is useful on platforms that have
	  an alternative way to set SMBASE.

config DEFAULT_X2APIC

	  FIXME: DMAR should have X2APIC optout bit set.

config X2APIC_ONLY
	prompt "Set X2APIC mode"
	bool
	depends on PARALLEL_MP
	help
	  coreboot and SMM runtime only use X2APIC mode.
	  Note: OS switches back to XAPIC mode if VT-d is disabled.
	  FIXME: S3 resume (and SMM runtime) will break if OS makes the switch.

config X2APIC_RUNTIME
	prompt "Support both XAPIC and X2APIC"
	bool
	depends on PARALLEL_MP
	help
	  The switch to X2APIC mode happens early in ramstage. SMM runtime can
	  support either mode in case the OS switches back to XAPIC.

config X2APIC_LATE_WORKAROUND
	prompt "Use XAPIC for AP bringup, then change to X2APIC"
	bool
	depends on PARALLEL_MP && MAX_CPUS < 256
	help
	  Choose this option if the platform supports dynamic switching between
	  XAPIC to X2APIC. The initial Application Processors (APs) are configured
	  in XAPIC mode at reset and later enable X2APIC as a CPU feature.
	  All access mechanisms between XAPIC (mmio) and X2APIC (msr) switches
	  at runtime when this option is enabled.

	  The CPU driver should select this if the CPU needs

config TSC_SYNC_MFENCE
	bool

	help
	  The CPU driver should select this if the CPU needs

	  rdtsc. This is true for all modern Intel CPUs.

config SETUP_XIP_CACHE
	bool
	depends on !NO_XIP_EARLY_STAGES
	help
	  Select this option to set up an MTRR to cache XIP stages loaded
	  from the bootblock. This is useful on platforms lacking a
	  non-eviction mode and therefore need to be careful to avoid
	  eviction.

	help
	  Top of Low Memory Segment (TSEG) is comprised of the SMRAM and IEDRAM.
	  SMRAM is a memory region used in SMM (System Management Mode) only.
	  IEDRAM is a memory region used for enhanced debug features.
	  SMM-mode processor access to TSEG always targets the physical DRAM.

config X86_INIT_NEED_1_SIPI
	bool
	default n
	help
	  This option limits the number of SIPI signals sent during the
	  common AP setup.  Intel documentation specifies an INIT SIPI SIPI
	  sequence, however this doesn't work on some AMD and Intel platforms.
	  These newer AMD and Intel platforms don't need the 10ms wait between
	  INIT and SIPI, so skip that too to save some time.

config SOC_SETS_MSRS
	bool
	default n
	help
	  The SoC requires different access methods for reading and writing
	  the MSRs.  Use SoC specific routines to handle the MSR access.

config RESERVE_MTRRS_FOR_OS
	bool
	default n
	help
	  This option allows a platform to reserve 2 MTRRs for the OS usage.
	  The Intel SDM documents that the first 6 MTRRs are intended for
	  the system BIOS and the last 2 are to be reserved for OS usage.
	  However, modern OSes use PAT to control cacheability instead of
	  using MTRRs.

config AP_STACK_SIZE

config RUNTIME_CONFIGURABLE_SMM_LOGLEVEL
	bool
	default n
	depends on DEBUG_SMI && CONSOLE_OVERRIDE_LOGLEVEL
	help
	  This enables setting the SMM console log level at runtime for more
	  flexibility to use different log levels for each stage. Another reason
	  is that reading the log level from non-volatile memory such as flash
	  VPD or CMOS is not very ideal to be done in SMM, with this option the
	  value can be passed via the member variable in struct smm_runtime and
	  be referenced directly in SMM.
