	  Enable support for flash based event logging.

	bool "Enable debug output for event logging"

config ELOG_CBMEM
	bool "Store a copy of ELOG in CBMEM"
	default n
	help
	 This option will have ELOG store a copy of the flash event log
	 in a CBMEM region and export that address in SMBIOS to the OS.
	 This is useful if the ELOG location is not in memory mapped flash,
	 but it means that events added at runtime via the SMI handler
	 will not be reflected in the CBMEM copy of the log.

	select SPI_FLASH_SMM if BOOT_DEVICE_SPI_FLASH_RW_NOMMAP
	default n
	help
	  This interface is compatible with the linux kernel driver
	  available with CONFIG_GOOGLE_GSMI and can be used to write
	  kernel reset/shutdown messages to the event log.

config ELOG_BOOT_COUNT
	depends on ELOG
	bool "Maintain a monotonic boot number in CMOS"
	default n
	help
	  Store a monotonic boot number in CMOS and provide an interface
	  to read the current value and increment the counter.  This boot
	  counter will be logged as part of the System Boot event.

config ELOG_BOOT_COUNT_CMOS_OFFSET
	depends on ELOG && ELOG_BOOT_COUNT && !USE_OPTION_TABLE
	int "Offset in CMOS to store the boot count"
	default 0
	help
	  This value must be greater than 16 bytes so as not to interfere
	  with the standard RTC region.  Requires 8 bytes.
