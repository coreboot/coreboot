	  Enable this option to read the hardware ID (HWID) from a
	  file in CBFS and use it to populate the SMBIOS product name.
	  The driver will read a file named 'hwid' from CBFS, process it
	  to extract the base HWID (trimming whitespace, removing 'hwid:'
	  prefix, and dropping everything after hyphen or space), and
	  use it as the SMBIOS system product name.
