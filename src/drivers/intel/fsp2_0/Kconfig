	  According to the FSP 2.x specification (section 11.3), the FSP populates the
	  NVS data using the FSP_NON_VOLATILE_STORAGE_HOB and expects the boot firmware
	  to parse the FSP_NON_VOLATILE_STORAGE_HOB after the FspMemoryInit() API in API
	  mode.

	  However, not all Intel SoC platforms that support the FSP 2.x specification
	  adhere to this requirement. For example, the FSP binary for XEON SP platform
	  produces NVS data (aka FSP_NON_VOLATILE_STORAGE_HOB) after the FspSiliconInit()
	  API. Therefore, attempting to locate NVS data after the FspMemoryInit() API on
