	  Include FSP 2.1 wrappers and functionality.
	  Features added into FSP 2.1 specification that impacts coreboot are:
	  1. Remove FSP stack switch and use the same stack with boot firmware
	  2. FSP should support external PPI interface pulled in via FSP_PEIM_TO_PEIM_INTERFACE

	  Add the FSP-M and FSP-S binaries to CBFS. Currently coreboot does not
	  use the FSP-T binary and it is not added.

	help
	  When selecting this option, the SoC must set FSP_HEADER_PATH
	  and FSP_FD_PATH correctly so FSP splitting works.

config FSP_USES_CB_STACK
	bool
	default n
	help
	  Enable support for fsp to use same stack as coreboot.
	  This option allows fsp to continue using coreboot stack
	  without reinitializing stack pointer. This feature is
	  supported Icelake onwards.

config FSP_TEMP_RAM_SIZE
	hex
	depends on FSP_USES_CB_STACK
	help
	  The amount of anticipated heap usage in CAR by FSP to setup HOB.
	  This configuration is applicable for FSP specification using shared
	  stack with coreboot/bootloader.
	  Sync this value with Platform FSP integration guide recommendation.

	help
	  Store hash of trained recovery MRC cache in NVRAM space in TPM.
	  Use the hash to validate recovery MRC cache before using it.
	  This hash needs to be updated every time recovery mode training
	  is recomputed, or if the hash does not match recovery MRC cache.
	  Selecting this option requires that TPM already be setup by this
	  point in time.  Thus it is only compatible when the option
	  VBOOT_STARTS_IN_BOOTBLOCK is selected, which causes verstage and
	  TPM setup to occur prior to memory initialization.

config FSP_PLATFORM_MEMORY_SETTINGS_VERSIONS
	bool
	help
	  This is selected by SoC or mainboard to supply their own
	  concept of a version for the memory settings respectively.
	  This allows deployed systems to bump their version number
	  with the same FSP which will trigger a retrain of the memory.

config FSP_PEIM_TO_PEIM_INTERFACE
	bool
	select FSP_USES_MP_SERVICES_PPI
	help
	  This option allows SOC user to create specific PPI for Intel FSP
	  usage, coreboot will provide required PPI structure definitions
	  along with all APIs as per EFI specification. So far this feature
	  is limited till EFI_PEI_MP_SERVICE_PPI and this option might be
	  useful to add further PPI if required.
