	  Generates a single ACPI device for the camera sensor and any
	  associated VCM or NVM devices on the same I2C bus, instead of
	  separate ACPI devices for each camera related device. The IPU
	  ACPI device is attached to the iGPU, not standalone. This is
	  the preferred method for Windows and mainline Linux.

config MIPI_ACPI_TYPE_CHROMEOS
	bool "Chrome OS"
	help
	  Generates separate ACPI devices for each camera related device.
	  The IPU ACPI device is generated separately from the iGPU.
	  This is the preferred method for ChromeOS.
