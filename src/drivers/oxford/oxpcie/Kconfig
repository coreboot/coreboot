	  Support for Oxford OXPCIe952 serial port PCIe cards.
	  Currently only devices with the vendor ID 0x1415 and device ID
	  0xc158 will work.
	  NOTE: Right now you have to set the base address of your OXPCIe952
	  card to exactly the value that the device allocator would set them
	  later on, or serial console functionality will stop as soon as the
	  resource allocator assigns a new base address to the device.
