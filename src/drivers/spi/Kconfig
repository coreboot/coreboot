config SPI_FLASH
	bool
	default n
	help
	  Select this option if your chipset driver needs to store certain
	  data in the SPI flash.

config SPI_ATOMIC_SEQUENCING
	bool
	default y if ARCH_X86
	default n if !ARCH_X86
	help
	  Select this option if the SPI controller uses "atomic sequencing."
	  Atomic sequencing is when the sequence of commands is pre-programmed
	  in the SPI controller. Hardware manages the transaction instead of
	  software. This is common on x86 platforms.

config SPI_FLASH_MEMORY_MAPPED
	bool
	default y if ARCH_X86
	default n if !ARCH_X86
	help
	  Inform system if SPI is memory-mapped or not.

config SPI_FLASH_SMM
	bool "SPI flash driver support in SMM"
	default n
	depends on HAVE_SMI_HANDLER
	help
	  Select this option if you want SPI flash support in SMM.

config SPI_FLASH_NO_FAST_READ
	bool "Disable Fast Read command"
	default n
	help
	  Select this option if your setup requires to avoid "fast read"s
	  from the SPI flash parts.

config SPI_FLASH_ADESTO
	bool
	default y if !COMMON_CBFS_SPI_WRAPPER
	help
	  Select this option if your chipset driver needs to store certain
	  data in the SPI flash and your SPI flash is made by Adesto Technologies.

config SPI_FLASH_AMIC
	bool
	default y if !COMMON_CBFS_SPI_WRAPPER
	help
	  Select this option if your chipset driver needs to store certain
	  data in the SPI flash and your SPI flash is made by AMIC.

config SPI_FLASH_ATMEL
	bool
	default y if !COMMON_CBFS_SPI_WRAPPER
	help
	  Select this option if your chipset driver needs to store certain
	  data in the SPI flash and your SPI flash is made by Atmel.

config SPI_FLASH_EON
	bool
	default y if !COMMON_CBFS_SPI_WRAPPER
	help
	  Select this option if your chipset driver needs to store certain
	  data in the SPI flash and your SPI flash is made by EON.

config SPI_FLASH_GIGADEVICE
	bool
	default y if !COMMON_CBFS_SPI_WRAPPER
	help
	  Select this option if your chipset driver needs to store certain
	  data in the SPI flash and your SPI flash is made by Gigadevice.

config SPI_FLASH_MACRONIX
	bool
	default y if !COMMON_CBFS_SPI_WRAPPER
	help
	  Select this option if your chipset driver needs to store certain
	  data in the SPI flash and your SPI flash is made by Macronix.

config SPI_FLASH_SPANSION
	bool
	default y if !COMMON_CBFS_SPI_WRAPPER
	help
	  Select this option if your chipset driver needs to store certain
	  data in the SPI flash and your SPI flash is made by Spansion.

	  data in the SPI flash and your SPI flash is made by Winbond.

config SPI_FLASH_FAST_READ_DUAL_OUTPUT_3B
	bool
	default n
	depends on SPI_FLASH
	help
	  Select this option if your SPI flash supports the fast read dual-
	  output command (opcode 0x3b) where the opcode and address are sent
