 * The dynamic cbmem infrastructure allows for growing cbmem dynamically as
 * things are added. It requires an external function, cbmem_top(), to be
 * implemented by the board or chipset to define the upper address where
 * cbmem lives. This address is required to be a 32-bit address. Additionally,
 * the address needs to be consistent in both romstage and ramstage.  The
 * dynamic cbmem infrastructure allocates new regions below the last allocated
 * region. Regions are defined by a cbmem_entry struct that is opaque. Regions
 * may be removed, but the last one added is the only that can be removed.
 *
 * Dynamic cbmem has two allocators within it. All allocators use a top down
 * allocation scheme. However, there are 2 modes for each allocation depending
 * on the requested size. There are large allocations and small allocations.
 * An allocation is considered to be small when it is less than or equal to
 * DYN_CBMEM_ALIGN_SIZE / 2. The smaller allocations are fit into a larger
 * allocation region.
