	bool

	help
	  Enables capability to cache DIMM SPDs in a dedicated FMAP region
	  to speed loading of SPD data. Currently requires board-level
	  romstage implementation to read/write/utilize cached SPD data.
	  When the default FMAP is used, will create a region named RW_SPD_CACHE
	  to store the cached SPD data.

	  If your platform really doesn't want to use an FMAP cache (e.g. due to

	help
	  This option enables eSPI library helper functions for displaying debug
	  information.

config NO_CBFS_MCACHE
	bool
	help
	  Disables the CBFS metadata cache. This means that your platform does
	  not need to provide a CBFS_MCACHE section in memlayout and can save
	  the associated CAR/SRAM size. In that case every single CBFS file
	  lookup must re-read the same CBFS directory entries from flash to find
	  the respective file.

config CBFS_CACHE_ALIGN
	int
	default 8
	help
	  Sets the alignment of the buffers returned by the cbfs_cache.

config CBFS_PRELOAD
	bool
	depends on COOP_MULTITASKING
	help
	  When enabled it will be possible to preload CBFS files into the
	  cbfs_cache. This helps reduce boot time by loading the files
	  in the background before they are actually required. This feature
	  depends on the read-only boot_device having a DMA controller to
	  perform the background transfer.

	help
	  This option enables the use of LZMA compression for the BMP logo.
	  LZMA is a lossless compression algorithm that can significantly reduce
	  the size of the logo, without sacrificing quality.

	  If this option is not enabled, the BMP logo will be uncompressed.

config BMP_LOGO_COMPRESS_LZ4
	bool "Compress BMP logo using LZ4"
	help
	  This option enables compression of the BMP logo using the LZ4 algorithm.
	  Although the size reduction is not as efficient as LZMA compression, however,
	  it can also make the boot process slightly faster compared to the LZMA.

	help
	  Enable low-battery indicator support in eSOL.

	  This option should be selected if the eSOL feature (using either libgfxinit or FSP uGOP)
	  supports displaying a low-battery indicator.

	  Platforms selecting `MAINBOARD_HAS_EARLY_LIBGFXINIT` can default enable this option.

	  For platforms using FSP uGOP, this option should only be enabled if uGOP has implemented
	  the necessary low-battery handling. This allows platforms to control low-battery
	  indicator support based on uGOP readiness.

	help
	  If enabled, this option displays a low battery indicator screen. This screen can be

config HAVE_EARLY_POWEROFF_SUPPORT
	bool
	help
	  Enable platform-specific early power off support.

	  This option should be selected if the platform requires special handling
	  to power off the system before memory initialization. This is often
	  necessary on Intel platforms, as directly powering off before memory
	  initialization is typically not supported by the chipset.

	  Selecting this option indicates that the platform implements the
	  `platform_do_early_poweroff()` function, which performs the
	  necessary hardware operations to initiate an early power off sequence.
	  This might involve configuring hardware registers, sending commands to
	  power management controllers, or other platform-specific operations.
