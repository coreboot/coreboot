To adapt for u-boot usage, only the applicable files were copied and
imported into the u-boot git repository.
Omitted:
* GPL - u-boot comes with a copy of the GPL license
* test subdirectory - not directly useful for u-boot

After importing, other customizations were performed.  See the git log
for details.
