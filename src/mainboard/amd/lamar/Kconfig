	  The PCI Express slot at J120 can be configured as an additional
	  DisplayPort connector using an adapter card from AMD or as a normal
	  PCI Express (x4) slot.

	  By default, the connector is configured as a PCI Express (x4) slot.

	  Select this option to enable the slot for use with one of AMD's
	  passive graphics port expander cards (only available from AMD).
