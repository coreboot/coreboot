/* One-letter commands for code not meant to be ready for humans.
 * The code was generated by a set of programs/scripts.
 * M print out a kernel message
 * R read a register. We do these mainly to ensure that if hardware wanted
 * the register read, it was read; also, in debug, we can see what was expected
 * and what was found. This has proven *very* useful to get this debugged.
 * The udelay, if non-zero, will make sure there is a
 * udelay() call with the value.
 * The count is from the kernel and tells us how many times this read was done.
 * Also useful for debugging and the state
 * machine uses the info to drive a poll.
 * W Write a register
 * V set verbosity. It's a bit mask.
 *   0 -> nothing
 *   1 -> print kernel messages
 *   2 -> print IO ops
 *   4 -> print the number of times we spin on a register in a poll
 *   8 -> restore whatever the previous verbosity level was
 *		(only one deep stack)
 *
 * Again, this is not really meant for human consumption. There is not a poll
 * operator as such because, sometimes, there is a read/write/read where the
 * second read is a poll, and this chipset is so touchy I'm reluctant to move
 * things around and/or delete too many reads.
