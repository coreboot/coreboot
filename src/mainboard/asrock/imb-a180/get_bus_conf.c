	 * after the decision about S3 resume is made, and before the system tables are
	 * written into RAM.  The routine that is responsible for writing the tables is
	 * "write_tables", called near the end of "hardwaremain".  There is no platform
	 * specific entry point between the S3 resume decision point and the call to
	 * "write_tables", and the next platform specific entry points are the calls to
	 * the ACPI table write functions.  The first of ose would seem to be the right
	 * place, but other table write functions, e.g. the PIRQ table write function, are
	 * called before the ACPI tables are written.  This routine is called at the beginning
	 * of each of the write functions called prior to the ACPI write functions, so this
	 * becomes the best place for this call.
