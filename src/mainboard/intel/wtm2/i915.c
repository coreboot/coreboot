/* how many bytes do we need for the framebuffer?
 * Well, this gets messy. To get an exact answer, we have
 * to ask the panel, but we'd rather zero the memory
 * and set up the gtt while the panel powers up. So,
 * we take a reasonable guess, secure in the knowledge that the
 * MRC has to overestimate the number of bytes used.
 * 8 MiB is a very safe guess. There may be a better way later, but
 * fact is, the initial framebuffer is only very temporary. And taking
 * a little long is ok; this is done much faster than the AUX
 * channel is ready for IO.

/* GTT is the Global Translation Table for the graphics pipeline.
 * It is used to translate graphics addresses to physical
 * memory addresses. As in the CPU, GTTs map 4K pages.
 * The setgtt function adds a further bit of flexibility:
 * it allows you to set a range (the first two parameters) to point
 * to a physical address (third parameter);the physical address is
 * incremented by a count (fourth parameter) for each GTT in the
 * range.
 * Why do it this way? For ultrafast startup,
 * we can point all the GTT entries to point to one page,
 * and set that page to 0s:
 * memset(physbase, 0, 4096);
 * setgtt(0, 4250, physbase, 0);
 * this takes about 2 ms, and is a win because zeroing
 * the page takes a up to 200 ms.
 * This call sets the GTT to point to a linear range of pages
 * starting at physbase.
