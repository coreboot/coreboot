There are a number of outstanding issues:

* I'm seeing toolchain issues. I can't get this tree to compile correctly with
gcc 4.3 (32 bit) - there is an optimization issue where certain parts of the
CBFS code execute very slowly. With gcc 3.4 (32 bit) that slowness
disappears. This is probably not a problem related to this port specifically.

* setting CONFIG_DEFAULT_CONSOLE_LOGLEVEL lower than 8 simply hangs the boot
shortly after the warm reset triggered by the MCP55 code. I think this too
might be a toolchain problem (but I see it on gcc 3.4 as well as 4.3).

* during startup, the CPU cores talk through each other on serial for a
while. Again, not an issue specific to this port.

* to avoid very slow LZMA decompression I use this port with LZMA compression
disabled in CBFS. I'm not sure what's causing this particular slowness.
