	  Select this option to add an Intel FSP binary to
	  the resulting coreboot image.

	  Note: Without this binary, coreboot builds relying on the FSP
	  will not boot

	  This is the default PCI ID for the sandybridge/ivybridge graphics
	  devices.  This string names the vbios rom in cbfs.  The following
	  PCI IDs will be remapped to load this rom:
	  0x80860102, 0x8086010a, 0x80860112, 0x80860116

	help
	  The location in cbfs that the FSP is located. This must match the

	  rebase the FSP with the Intel's BCT (tool).

	  On Sandybridge and Ivybridge systems the firmware image may
	  have to store a lot more than just coreboot, including:
	   - a firmware descriptor
	   - Intel Management Engine firmware
	  This option specifies the maximum size of the CBFS portion in the

	help
	  Enabling this feature will cause MRC data to be cached in NV storage
	  which will speed up boot time on future reboots and/or power cycles.

	  WARNING: This feature combined with the CACHE_ROM may result in undefined
	  behavior.

config MRC_CACHE_SIZE
	hex "MRC Data Cache Size"

	  cache storage when using fast boot.

	hex "Virtual ROM Size"
	default ROM_SIZE
	depends on ENABLE_FAST_BOOT
	help
	  This is used to calculate the offset of the MRC data cache in NV
	  Storage for "Fast Boot".  If in doubt, leave this set to the default
	  which sets the virtual size equal to the ROM size.

	  Example: Cougar Canyon 2 has 2 8 MB SPI ROMs.  When the SPI ROMs are
	  loaded with a 4 MB coreboot image, the virtual ROM size is 8 MB.  When
	  the SPI ROMs are loaded with an 8 MB coreboot image, the virtual ROM
	  size is 16 MB.
