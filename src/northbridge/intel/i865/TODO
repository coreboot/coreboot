TODO (probably incomplete)

raminit.c:
	* re-use the mchbar macro from i945 and read/write from/to it like its raminit code does
	* GPL headers everywhere
	* includes (is assert.h really needed?)
	* set TOUD (from northbridge.c?)
	* set SMFREQ and FSBFREQ (in GMCHCFG) (from northbridge.c?)?
	* AGP (device 1) code
	* VGA/IGD (device 2) code
	* CSA (device 3) code?
	* clean up/trim northbridge_set_registers()
	* dual-channel code (and don't forget romstage.c)

DONE
* raise bits 0 (IOAE, I/O access enable) and 1 (MAE, memory access enable) in PCICMD6 (from northbridge.c?)
