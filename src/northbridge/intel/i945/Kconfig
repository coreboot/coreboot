	  Usually system firmware turns off system memory clock
	  signals to unused SO-DIMM slots to reduce EMI and power
	  consumption.
	  However, some boards do not like unused clock signals to
	  be disabled.

	  If non-zero, this designates the maximum DDR frequency
	  the board supports, despite what the chipset should be
	  capable of.
