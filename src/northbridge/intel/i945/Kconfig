	  Usually system firmware turns off system memory clock
	  signals to unused SO-DIMM slots to reduce EMI and power
	  consumption.
	  However, some boards do not like unused clock signals to
	  be disabled.

	  If non-zero, this designates the maximum DDR frequency
	  the board supports, despite what the chipset should be
	  capable of.

config CHECK_SLFRCS_ON_RESUME
	def_bool n
	help
	  On some boards it may be neccessary to hard reset early
	  during resume from S3 if the SLFRCS register indicates that
	  a memory channel is not guaranteed to be in self-refresh.
	  On other boards the check always creates a false positive,
	  effectively making it impossible to resume.
