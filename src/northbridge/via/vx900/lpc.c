 * STATUS:
 * We do a fair bit of setup, and most of it seems to work fairly well. There
 * are still a few FIXME items here and there, but overall, this code hasn't
 * been touched much from its initial 2012 version to 2013, when it was revived.
 *
 * We do the IOAPIC setup with the assumption that it is declared in the
 * mainboard's devicetree.cb. We cannot use the IOAPIC however. The interrupts
 * do not make it to the CPU. This issue is still under investigation.
 *
 * We also route PIRQs with CONFIG_PIRQ_ROUTE. This is currently the only way to
 * get interrupts working.
 *
 * On the VX900, the keyboard can be connected directly to the chipset
 * (referenced as "internal keyboard" in the documents). As long as that is the
 * case (not connected to the superIO), and we disable the superIO keyboard LDN,
 * it will work, but perhaps this should be more configurable.
