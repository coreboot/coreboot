 * \brief VX900: Set up the north module IOAPIC (for PCIE and VGA)
 *
 * Enable the IOAPIC in the south module, and properly set it up.
 * \n
 * This is the hardware specific initialization for the IOAPIC, and complements
 * the setup done by the generic IOAPIC driver. In order for the IOAPIC to work
 * properly, it _must_ be declared in devicetree.cb .
 * \n
 * We are assuming this is called before the drivers/generic/ioapic code,
 * which should be the case if devicetree.cb is set up properly.
