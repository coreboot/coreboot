	  Enabling the STM will load a simple hypervisor into SMM that will
	  restrict the actions of the SMI handler, which is the part of BIOS
	  that functions in system management mode (SMM).  The kernel can
	  configure the STM to prevent the SMI handler from accessing platform
	  resources.
	  The STM closes a vulnerability in Intel TXT (D-RTM)
	  The SMI handler provides a list of platform resources that it
	  requires access to the STM during STM startup, which the kernel
	  cannot override.
	  An additional capability, called STM-PE, provides a protected
	  execution capability that allows modules to be executed without
	  observation and interference. Examples of usage include kernel
	  introspection and virtualized trusted platform module (vTPM).
	  Requirement: SMM must be enabled and there must be sufficient room
	  within the TSEG to fit the MSEG.
