	  Select this option to add data fabric configuration related

	help
	  Select this option to add functionality to the build to tell the
	  resource allocator about the MMIO regions configured in the data
	  fabric registers so that it knows in which regions it can properly
	  allocate the non-fixed MMIO devices.

	bool

	help
	  Some AMD SoCs support more than one PCI segment with 256 buses. Those
	  SoCs however have a different data fabric register layout for the PCI
	  bus number decoding. SoCs that use a data fabric register pair for
	  the PCI bus number which includes the segment number must select this
	  option; SoCs that use one data fabric register for the PCI bus number
	  which doesn't include a segment number field mustn't select this.

config SOC_AMD_COMMON_BLOCK_DATA_FABRIC_EXTENDED_MMIO
	bool
	depends on SOC_AMD_COMMON_BLOCK_DATA_FABRIC_DOMAIN
	help
	  Some AMD SoCs support more than 48 bit MMIO addresses. In order to
	  have enough bits for this, the MMIO address extension register is
	  introduced. SoCs that have this register must select this option in
	  order for the MMIO regions to be reported correctly.
