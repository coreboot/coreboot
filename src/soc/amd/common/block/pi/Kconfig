	help
	  The AGESA PI blob may be built to allow an optional callout for
	  AgesaHeapRebase.  If AGESA calls AgesaHeapRebase, this option
	  determines the location of the heap prior to DRAM availability.

config PI_AGESA_TEMP_RAM_BASE
	hex
	default 0x100000
	help
	  During a boot from S5, AGESA copies its CAR-based heap to a temporary
	  location in DRAM.  Once coreboot has established cbmem, the heap
	  is moved again.  This symbol determines the temporary location for
	  the heap.

config PI_AGESA_HEAP_SIZE
	hex
	default 0x20000
	help
	  This option determines the amount of space allowed for AGESA heap
	  prior to DRAM availability.
