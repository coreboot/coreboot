config INTEL_HAS_TOP_SWAP
	bool
	help
	  Set this config if the Intel SoC supports top swap feature

config INTEL_ADD_TOP_SWAP_BOOTBLOCK
	bool "Include a Top swap bootblock"
	default n
	depends on INTEL_HAS_TOP_SWAP
	help
	  Intel PCH/Southbridges have feature that it is possible to have
	  the southbridge/PCH look for the bootblock at a 64K or
	  128K/256K/512K/1MB (in case of newer SoCs) offset
	  instead of the usual top of flash.
	  Select this to put a 'second' bootblock.

config INTEL_TOP_SWAP_BOOTBLOCK_SIZE
	hex "Size of top swap boot block"
	depends on INTEL_ADD_TOP_SWAP_BOOTBLOCK
	default 0x10000
	help
	  Set this config to a supported topswap size.
	  Valid sizes: 0x10000 0x20000 0x40000 0x80000 0x100000

config INTEL_TOP_SWAP_FIT_ENTRY_FMAP_REG
	string
	depends on INTEL_ADD_TOP_SWAP_BOOTBLOCK
	help
	  Use this config to specify the name of a FMAP region (which should
	  hold a microcode) whose address as the first entry in the topswap FIT.
	  This is useful in creating a asymmetric FIT in top swap bootblock
	  than the one in non-topswap bootblock. This string will be passed
	  onto ifittool (-A -n option). ifittool will not parse the region for MCU
	  entries, and only locate the region and insert its address into FIT.
