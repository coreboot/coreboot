	  This flag indicates that the SoC implements GPE1. GPE1 Event Bit is an
	  extension of GPE0 (present in all Intel SoC platform). GPE1 Events is
	  SoC-specific, which might include the power management, hot plug, and
	  PCIe events for the internal devices. Select this Kconfig to support SoCs
	  that publish GPE1 as part of PMC IO register. The dummy GPE1_ macros with
	  their values set to '0' will be added when this flag is not set for
	  backward compatibility matter.

	help
	  This flags will expose GPE1 STS and EN registers in FADT. SoC needs to
	  have GPE1 block implemented to select this.  It is required to define
	  GPE1_STS(), GPE_EN(), and GPE1_REG_MAX from the SoC header. When selected,
	  GPE1 functions will be added and GPE1 events will be cleared and disabled
	  during boot. The SoC is required to provide the overridden GPE1 functions.
	  In addition, this flag will also be used to determine the standard GPE0/1
	  event methods to use in the ASL code and devicetree for the internal wake
	  capable devices. The purpose of this flag is to enable to switch in
	  between new GPE1 approach and old GPE0 method. The mainboard should decide
	  to use the GPE1 via this flag; or else
	  SOC_INTEL_COMMON_BLOCK_ACPI_HAVE_GPE1 exposes a SoC capability using ACPI.
