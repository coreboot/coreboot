config SOC_INTEL_COMMON_BLOCK_CPU
	bool
	default n
	help
	  This option helps to select Intel Common CPU Model support code
	  which provides various CPU related APIs which are common
	  between all Intel Processor families. Common CPU code is supported
	  for SOCs starting from SKL,KBL,APL, and future.

config SOC_INTEL_COMMON_BLOCK_CAR
	bool
	default n
	help
	  This option allows you to select how cache-as-ram (CAR) is set up.

config INTEL_CAR_NEM
	bool
	default n
	help
	  Traditionally, CAR is set up by using Non-Evict mode. This method
	  does not allow CAR and cache to co-exist, because cache fills are
	  blocked in NEM.

config INTEL_CAR_CQOS
	bool
	default n
	help
	  Cache Quality of Service allows more fine-grained control of cache
	  usage. As result, it is possible to set up a portion of L2 cache for
	  CAR and use the remainder for actual caching.

config INTEL_CAR_NEM_ENHANCED
	bool
	default n
	help
	  A current limitation of NEM (Non-Evict mode) is that code and data sizes
	  are derived from the requirement to not write out any modified cache line.
	  With NEM, if there is no physical memory behind the cached area,
	  the modified data will be lost and NEM results will be inconsistent.
	  ENHANCED NEM guarantees that modified data is always
	  kept in cache while clean data is replaced.
