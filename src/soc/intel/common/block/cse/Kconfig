	help
	  This configuration option stores CSE RW FW version in CBMEM area.
	  This information can be used to identify if the CSE firmware update is successful
	  by comparing the currently running CSE RW firmware version against CSE version
	  belongs to the CONFIG_SOC_INTEL_CSE_RW_VERSION (decided statically while
	  building the AP FW image).

	  The way to retrieve the CSE firmware version is by sending the HECI command to
	  read the CSE Boot Partition (BP) info. The cost of sending HECI command to read
	  the CSE FW version is between 7ms-20ms (depending on the SoC architecture) hence,
	  ensure this feature is platform specific and only enabled for the platform
	  that would like to store the CSE version into the CBMEM.

	help
	  This configuration option stores ISH version in CBMEM area.
	  This information can be used to identify the currently running ISH firmware
	  version.

	  ISH BUP is sitting inside the CSE firmware partition. The way to retrieve the
	  ISH version is by sending the HECI command to read the CSE FPT. The cost of sending
	  HECI command to read the CSE FPT is significant (~200ms) hence, the idea is to
	  read the CSE RW version on every cold reset (to cover the CSE update scenarios)
	  and store into CBMEM to avoid the cost of resending the HECI command in all
	  consecutive warm boots.

	  Later boot stages can just read the CBMEM ID to retrieve the ISH version.

	  Additionally, ensure this feature is platform specific hence, only enabled
	  for the platform that would like to store the ISH version into the CBMEM and
	  parse to perform some additional work.

	  Use this config to send End Of Post (EOP) earlier through SoC code in order to
	  reduce time required to send EOP and getting CSE response.
	  In later stages, CSE might be busy and might require more time to process EOP command.

	  using boot state either `BS_PAYLOAD_BOOT` or `BS_PAYLOAD_LOAD` from common code
	  in order to reduce time required to send EOP and getting CSE response.
	  It has been observed that CSE might be busy and might require more time to
	  process the EOP command.
	  SoC can use this Kconfig to send EOP later by itself.
	  Starting with Jasper Lake, coreboot sends EOP before loading payload hence, this

	depends on !SOC_INTEL_CSE_SEND_EOP_EARLY
	help
	  Use this config to handle End Of Post (EOP) completion
	  asynchronously. The EOP command is sent first and the result
	  is checked later leaving time to CSE to complete the
	  operation while coreboot perform other activities.
	  Performing EOP asynchronously reduces the time spent
	  actively waiting for command completion which can have a
	  significant impact on boot time.

	  Using this asynchronous approach comes with the limitation
	  that no HECI command should be sent between the time the EOP
	  request is posted (at CSE .final device operation) and the
	  time coreboot check for its completion (BS_PAYLOAD_LOAD).
