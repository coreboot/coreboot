	  Sets up USB2/3 port mapping in TCSS MUX

config SOC_INTEL_TCSS_USE_PDC_PMC_USBC_MUX_CONFIGURATION
	def_bool n
	help
	  TCSS uses PDC<->PMC communication to perform mux configuration. When this config is
	  enabled, communication happens directly between PDC and PMC. Avoid sending PMC
	  commands from AP/EC.

config TCSS_HAS_USBC_OPS

	help
	  Enable USB-C operations via the EC. Requires `usbc_get_ops` to control features
	  such as HPD and DP Mode entry. Currently, only the ChromeEC implements this, see
	  (ec/google/chromeec/usbc_mux.c).

	  This results in the MUX being set to a disabled state.

config ENABLE_TCSS_DISPLAY_DETECTION

	  Enable displays to be detected over Type-C ports during boot.

config ENABLE_TCSS_USB_DETECTION
	bool "Enable detection of USB boot devices attached to USB Type-C ports with TCSS"
	depends on TCSS_HAS_USBC_OPS
	help
	  Enable USB-C attached storage devices to be detected at boot.
	  This option is required for some payloads (eg, edk2), without which devices attached
	  to USB-C ports will not be detected and available to boot from.
