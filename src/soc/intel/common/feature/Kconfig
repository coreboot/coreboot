	  Intel SoC common feature code. This option enables sharing of
	  SoC-specific code across Intel SoC generations to reduce code
	  duplication. Unlike the common block code which is intended for
	  reusable IP blocks, the feature code is for SoC-specific
	  functionality that is similar across multiple generations but
	  may have minor platform-specific differences handled through
	  configuration options or platform-specific macros.
