	  Avoid disabling and re-enabling the MMU during QCLib execution.

	  Select this option if the platform's QCLib version supports running
	  within the existing coreboot MMU configuration without modification.

	  Enabling this reduces boot latency by eliminating redundant cache
	  flushes and TLB invalidations associated with mmu_disable() and
	  mmu_enable() calls.
