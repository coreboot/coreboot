	  Select this if you want to write-protect the whole firmware flash
	  chip. The locking will take place during the chipset lockdown, which
	  is either triggered by coreboot (when INTEL_CHIPSET_LOCKDOWN is set)
	  or has to be triggered later (e.g. by the payload or the OS).

	        you won't be able to write to the flash chip using the
	        internal programmer any more.

	help
	  Select this if you want to protect the firmware flash against all
	  further accesses (with the exception of the memory mapped BIOS re-
	  gion which is always readable). The locking will take place during
	  the chipset lockdown, which is either triggered by coreboot (when
	  INTEL_CHIPSET_LOCKDOWN is set) or has to be triggered later (e.g.
	  by the payload or the OS).
