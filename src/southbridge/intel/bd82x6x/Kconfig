	  If you don't have an Intel Firmware Descriptor (ifd.bin) for your
	  board, you can select this option and coreboot will build without it.
	  Though, the resulting coreboot.rom will not contain all parts required
	  to get coreboot running on your board. You can however write only the
	  BIOS section to your board's flash ROM and keep the other sections
	  untouched. Unfortunately the current version of flashrom doesn't
	  support this yet. But there is a patch pending [1].

	  WARNING: Never write a complete coreboot.rom to your flash ROM if it
		   was built with a fake IFD. It just won't work.

	  The Intel processor in the selected system requires a special firmware
	  for an integrated controller called Management Engine (ME). The ME
	  firmware might be provided in coreboot's 3rdparty repository. If
	  not and if you don't have the firmware elsewhere, you can still
	  build coreboot without it. In this case however, you'll have to make
	  sure that you don't overwrite your ME firmware on your flash ROM.

	default n
	help
	  The Intel Management Engine supports preventing write accesses
	  from the host to the Management Engine section in the firmware
	  descriptor. If the ME section is locked, it can only be overwritten
	  with an external SPI flash programmer. You will want this if you
	  want to increase security of your ROM image once you are sure
	  that the ME firmware is no longer going to change.

	  If unsure, say N.

config LOCK_SPI_ON_RESUME
	bool "Lock all flash ROM sections on S3 resume"
	default n
	help
	  If the flash ROM shall be protected against write accesses from the
	  operating system (OS), the locking procedure has to be repeated after
	  each resume from S3. Select this if you never want to update the flash
	  ROM from within your OS. Notice: Even with this option, the write lock
	  has still to be enabled on the normal boot path (e.g. by the payload).
