	  The Intel processor in the selected system requires a special firmware
	  for an integrated controller.  This might be called the Management
	  Engine (ME), the Trusted Execution Engine (TXE) or something else
	  depending on the chip. This firmware might or might not be available
	  in coreboot's 3rdparty/blobs repository. If it is not and if you don't
	  have access to the firmware from elsewhere, you can still build
	  coreboot without it. In this case however, you'll have to make sure
	  that you don't overwrite your ME/TXE firmware on your flash ROM.

	  Use me_cleaner to remove all the non-fundamental code from the Intel
	  ME/TXE firmware.
	  The resulting Intel ME/TXE firmware will have only the code
	  responsible for the very basic hardware initialization, leaving the
	  ME/TXE subsystem essentially in a disabled state.

	  Don't flash a modified ME/TXE firmware and a new coreboot image at the
	  same time, test them in two different steps.

	  WARNING: this tool isn't based on any official Intel documentation but
	           only on reverse engineering and trial & error.

	help
	  If you don't have an Intel Firmware Descriptor (descriptor.bin) for your
	  board, you can select this option and coreboot will build without it.
	  The resulting coreboot.rom will not contain all parts required
	  to get coreboot running on your board. You can however write only the
	  BIOS section to your board's flash ROM and keep the other sections
	  untouched. Unfortunately the current version of flashrom doesn't
	  support this yet. But there is a patch pending [1].

	  WARNING: Never write a complete coreboot.rom to your flash ROM if it
	           was built with a fake IFD. It just won't work.

	  The Gigabit Ethernet ROM region is used when an Intel NIC is built into

	  The Intel Firmware Descriptor supports preventing write accesses
	  from the host to the ME or TXE section in the firmware
	  descriptor. If the section is locked, it can only be overwritten
	  with an external SPI flash programmer. You will want this if you
	  want to increase security of your ROM image once you are sure

	  If unsure, say N.
