	  The Intel Management Engine supports preventing write accesses
	  from the host to the Management Engine section in the firmware
	  descriptor. If the ME section is locked, it can only be overwritten
	  with an external SPI flash programmer. You will want this if you
	  want to increase security of your ROM image once you are sure
	  that the ME firmware is no longer going to change.

	  If unsure, say N.
