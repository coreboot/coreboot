/**
 * @page starthere Initial Porting and Integration
 *
 * @par Basic Check List
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> Copy the \<plat\>Options.c file from the Addendum directory to the platform tip build directory.
 * AMD recommends the use of a sub-directory named AGESA to contain these files and the build output files.
 * <li> Copy the OptionsIds.h content in the spec to OptionsIds.h in the platform build tip directory
 * and make changes to enable the IDS support desired. It is highly recommended to set the following for
 * initial integration and development:@n
 * @code
 * #define IDSOPT_IDS_ENABLED TRUE
 * #define IDSOPT_ERROR_TRAP_ENABLED TRUE
 * #define IDSOPT_ASSERT_ENABLED TRUE
 * @endcode
 * <li> Edit and modify the option selections in those two files to meet the needs of the specific platform.
 * <li> Set the environment variable AGESA_ROOT to the root folder of the AGESA code.
 * <li> Set the environment variable AGESA_OptsDir the platform build tip AGESA directory.
 * <li> Generate the doxygen documentation or locate the file arch2008.chm within your AGESA release package.
 * </ul>
 *
 * @par Debugging Using ASSERT and IDS_ERROR_TRAP
 *
 * While AGESA code uses ::ASSERT and ::IDS_ERROR_TRAP to check for internal errors, these macros can also
 * catch and assist debug of wrapper and platform BIOS issues.
 *
 * When an ::ASSERT fails or an ::IDS_ERROR_TRAP is executed, the AGESA code will enter a halt loop and display a
 * Stop Code.  A Stop Code is eight hex digits.  The first (most significant) four are the FILECODE.
 * FILECODEs can be looked up in Filecode.h to determine which file contains the stop macro.  Each file has a
 * unique code value.
 * The least significant digits are the line number in that file.
 * For example, 0210 means the macro is on line two hundred ten.
 * (see ::IdsErrorStop for more details on stop code display.)
 *
 * Enabling ::ASSERT and ::IDS_ERROR_TRAP ensure errors are caught and also provide a useful debug assist.
 * Comments near each macro use will describe the nature of the error and typical wrapper errors or other
 * root causes.
 *
 * After your wrapper consistently executes ::ASSERT and ::IDS_ERROR_TRAP stop free, you can disable them in
 * OptionsIds.h, except for regression testing.  IDS is not expected to be enabled in production BIOS builds.
