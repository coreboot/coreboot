/**
 * @page cpufeatimpl CPU Generic Feature Implementation Guide
 *
 * The CPU generic feature dispatcher provides services which can be used to implement a
 * wide range of features in a manner that isolates calling code from knowledge about which
 * families or features are supported in the current build.
 *
 * @par Determine if a New Feature is a Suitable Candidate
 *
 * A feature must meet the following requirements:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Any core in the system must be able to determine if the feature should be enabled or not.
 *
 *   <ul>
 *   <li> MSRs cannot be read in multisocket systems in the 'IsEnabled' function.
 *
 *   <li> Cores cannot be launched in the 'IsEnabled' function.
 *   </ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @par Determine the Time Point at which the Feature Should be Enabled
 *
 * Factors to consider in making this determination:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> Determine if there are any dependencies on other settings that require strict ordering.
 *
 * <li> Consider the state of the APs that you will need.
 *
 * <li> Remember that features enabled during AmdInitEarly will automatically be restored on S3 resume.
 * </ul>
 *
 * @par Implementing a new feature
 *
 * Perform the following steps to implement a new feature:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> Create a unique equate for your time point, @b if you cannot use an existing time point.
 *
 * <li> Create a new value in the DISPATCHABLE_CPU_FEATURES enum for your feature.
 *
 * <li> Add a new 'C' file to the Features folder for your feature.
 *
 *   <ul>
 *   <li> The 'C' file must implement 2 functions -- 'IsEnabled' and 'Initialize'
 *
 *   <li> The 'C' file must instantiate a CPU_FEATURE_DESCRIPTOR structure.
 *   </ul>
 *
 * <li> Add a new 'H' file to the Features folder for your feature.
 *
 *   <ul>
 *   <li> The 'H' file declares whatever family specific functions required by the feature.
 *
 *   <li> The 'H' file declares a structure containing all family specific functions.  For a reference
 *        example, your feature API should have a set of conventions similar to cpu specific services,
 *        @ref cpuimplfss.
 *   </ul>
 *
 * <li> Create 'C' files in all applicable family folders.
 *
 *   <ul>
 *   <li> Implement the required family specific functions.
 *
 *   <li> Instantiate a family specific services structure.
 *   </ul>
 *
 * <li> Create \<feature name\>Install.h in the include folder.
 *
 *   <ul>
 *   <li> Add logic to determine when your feature should be included in the build.
 *
 *   <li> If the feature should be included, define OPTION_\<feature name\> to the address of your
 *        CPU_FEATURE_DESCRIPTOR instantiation.  If not, define OPTION_\<feature name\> to be blank.
 *
 *   <li> Create a family translation table pointing to all applicable instantiations of
 *        family specific function structures.
 *   </ul>
 *
 * <li> Modify OptionCpuFeaturesInstall.h in the include folder.
 *
 *   <ul>
 *   <li> Include \<feature name\>Install.h.
 *
 *   <li> Add OPTION_\<feature name\> to the SupportedCpuFeatureList array.
 *   </ul>
 *
 * <li> If a new time point was created, add a call to DispatchCpuFeatures at the desired location,
 *      passing your new time point equate.
 * </ul>
