 *   Define the RELEASE VERSION string
 *
 * The Release Version string should identify the next planned release.
 * When a branch is made in preparation for a release, the release manager
 * should change/confirm that the branch version of this file contains the
 * string matching the desired version for the release. The trunk version of
 * the file should always contain a trailing 'X'. This will make sure that a
 * development build from trunk will not be confused for a released version.
 * The release manager will need to remove the trailing 'X' and update the
 * version string as appropriate for the release. The trunk copy of this file
 * should also be updated/incremented for the next expected version, + trailing 'X'
