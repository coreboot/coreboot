/**
 * @page htgraphdesign Graph Support routines
 *
 * These routines provide support for dealing with the graph representation
 * of the topologies, along with the routing table information for that topology.
 * The routing information is compressed and these routines currently decompress
 * 'on the fly'.  A graph is represented as a set of routes. All the edges in the
 * graph are routes; a direct route from Node i to Node j exists in the graph IFF
 * there is an edge directly connecting Node i to Node j.  All other routes designate
 * the edge which the route to that Node initially takes, by designating a Node
 * to which a direct connection exists.  That is, the route to non-adjacent Node j
 * from Node i specifies Node k where Node i directly connects to Node k.
 *
 *@code
 * pseudo definition of compressed graph:
 * typedef struct
 * {
 *     // First byte
 *     UINT8 broadcast[8]:1;   // that is, 8 1-bit values
 *     // Second byte
 *     UINT8 requestRoute:4;   // [3:0]
 *     UINT8 responseRoute:4;  // [7:4]
 * } sRoute;
 * typedef struct
 * {
 *     UINT8 size;
 *     sRoute graph[size][size];
