	help
	  Disable the platform hierarchy on resume path if the firmware
	  is involved in resume. The hierarchy is disabled prior to jumping
	  to the OS.  Note that this option is sepcific to TPM2 boards.
	  This option is auto selected if CHROMEOS because it matches with
	  vboot_reference model which disables the platform hierarchy in
	  the boot loader. However, those operations need to be symmetric
	  on normal boot as well as resume and coreboot is only involved
	  in the resume piece w.r.t. the platform hierarchy.

	help
	  On some boards, there are calibrated parameters for Dynamic Speaker Management(DSM)
	  stored in VPD. Enable this config to read and parse these VPD values and write them
	  to ACPI DSD table in device driver. These parameters will be applied by kernel driver
	  through device property at boot.

config CHROMEOS_DSM_PARAM_FILE_NAME
	bool
	default n
	help
	  On some boards, there are different dsm parameter files for Dynamic Speaker
	  Management (DSM). Enable this config to assign dsm parameters file name in ACPI
	  SSDT table. Kernel driver uses this to load the DSM parameter file.

config CHROMEOS_CSE_BOARD_RESET_OVERRIDE
	bool
	default n
	depends on SOC_INTEL_CSE_LITE_SKU
	help
	  On some boards that run old firmware version in cr50, Embedded Controller (EC) needs
	  to trigger the cold reset of Application Processor (AP) when CSE jumps from RO to RW
	  so that cr50 resets the TPM state. This is required on boards where the cr50 firmware
	  does not understand the new cr50 strap config (applicable only to boards using strap
	  config 0xe). Enabling this config will help to override the default global reset.
