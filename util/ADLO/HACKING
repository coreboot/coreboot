DEVELOPER/HACKING/DESIGN

- bochs bios.

	we expect most of the bochs patches will be rolled back into
	the bochs mainline.

	thus when designing an patch for rombios.c both needs of 
	linuxbios as well as bochs needed to be taken into 
	consideration.

- there are motherboard specific code in loader.s. until this issue
  	is fixed, you need to adjust various motherboard specific
	settings in loader.s In particular control of the 
	shadow ram.
