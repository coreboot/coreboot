/*
 * Short form: this is complicated, but we've tried making it simple
 * and we keep hitting problems with our ELF parsing.
 *
 * The ELF parsing situation has always been a bit tricky.  In fact,
 * we (and most others) have been getting it wrong in small ways for
 * years. Recently this has caused real trouble for the ARM V8 build.
 * In this file we attempt to finally get it right for all variations
 * of endian-ness and word size and target architectures and
 * architectures we might get run on. Phew!. To do this we borrow a
 * page from the FreeBSD NFS xdr model (see elf_ehdr and elf_phdr),
 * the Plan 9 endianness functions (see xdr.c), and Go interfaces (see
 * how we use buffer structs in this file). This ends up being a bit
 * wordy at the lowest level, but greatly simplifies the elf parsing
 * code and removes a common source of bugs, namely, forgetting to
 * flip type endianness when referencing a struct member.
 *
 * ELF files can have four combinations of data layout: 32/64, and
 * big/little endian.  Further, to add to the fun, depending on the
 * word size, the size of the ELF structs varies. The coreboot SELF
 * format is simpler in theory: it's supposed to be always BE, and the
 * various struct members allow room for growth: the entry point is
 * always 64 bits, for example, so the size of a SELF struct is
 * constant, regardless of target architecture word size.  Hence, we
 * need to do some transformation of the ELF files.
 *
 * A given architecture, realistically, only supports one of the four
 * combinations at a time as the 'native' format. Hence, our code has
 * been sprinkled with every variation of [nh]to[hn][sll] over the
 * years. We've never quite gotten it all right, however, and a quick
 * pass over this code revealed another bug.  It's all worked because,
 * until now, all the working platforms that had CBFS were 32 LE. Even then,
 * however, bugs crept in: we recently realized that we're not
 * transforming the entry point to big format when we store into the
 * SELF image.
 *
 * The problem is essentially an XDR operation:
 * we have something in a foreign format and need to transform it.
 * It's most like XDR because:
 * 1) the byte order can be wrong
 * 2) the word size can be wrong
 * 3) the size of elements in the stream depends on the value
 *    of other elements in the stream
 * it's not like XDR because:
 * 1) the byte order can be right
 * 2) the word size can be right
 * 3) the struct members are all on a natural alignment
 *
 * Hence, this new approach.  To cover word size issues, we *always*
 * transform the two structs we care about, the file header and
 * program header, into a native struct in the 64 bit format:
 *
 * [32,little] -> [Elf64_Ehdr, Elf64_Phdr]
 * [64,little] -> [Elf64_Ehdr, Elf64_Phdr]
 * [32,big] -> [Elf64_Ehdr, Elf64_Phdr]
 * [64,big] -> [Elf64_Ehdr, Elf64_Phdr]
 * Then we just use those structs, and all the need for inline ntoh* goes away,
 * as well as all the chances for error.
 * This works because all the SELF structs have fields large enough for
 * the largest ELF 64 struct members, and all the Elf64 struct members
 * are at least large enough for all ELF 32 struct members.
 * We end up with one function to do all our ELF parsing, and two functions
 * to transform the headers. For the put case, we also have
 * XDR functions, and hopefully we'll never again spend 5 years with the
 * wrong endian-ness on an output value :-)
 * This should work for all word sizes and endianness we hope to target.
 * I *really* don't want to be here for 128 bit addresses.
 *
 * The parse functions are called with a pointer to an input buffer
 * struct. One might ask: are there enough bytes in the input buffer?
 * We know there need to be at *least* sizeof(Elf32_Ehdr) +
 * sizeof(Elf32_Phdr) bytes. Realistically, there has to be some data
 * too.  If we start to worry, though we have not in the past, we
 * might apply the simple test: the input buffer needs to be at least
 * sizeof(Elf64_Ehdr) + sizeof(Elf64_Phdr) bytes because, even if it's
 * ELF 32, there's got to be *some* data! This is not theoretically
 * accurate but it is actually good enough in practice. It allows the
 * header transformation code to ignore the possibility of underrun.
 *
 * We also must accomodate different ELF files, and hence formats,
 * in the same cbfs invocation. We might load a 64-bit payload
 * on a 32-bit machine; we might even have a mixed armv7/armv8
 * SOC or even a system with an x86/ARM!
 *
 * A possibly problematic (though unlikely to be so) assumption
 * is that we expect the BIOS to remain in the lowest 32 bits
 * of the physical address space. Since ARMV8 has standardized
 * on that, and x86_64 also has, this seems a safe assumption.
 *
 * To repeat, ELF structs are different sizes because ELF struct
 * members are different sizes, depending on values in the ELF file
 * header. For this we use the functions defined in xdr.c, which
 * consume bytes, convert the endianness, and advance the data pointer
 * in the buffer struct.
