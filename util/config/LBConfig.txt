LBConfig is a simply Python program to build files that are in turned
used to build the LinuxBIOS. Typically, LBConfig builds three files:

Makefile
ldscript.ld
crt0.S

These files are placed in a target directory specified in the config
file itself.

LBConfig uses a Little Language that is specific to the task of describing 
LinuxBIOS components, build options, linker scripts, and any ancillary 
make targets. The language is simple and we want to keep it that way. 

The basic operating mode is that the user invokes the program,
specifying a config file, and the top of the freebios tree (from now
on we will call the top of the freebios tree $(TOP)). The first Config
file specifies a mainboard vendor and name in Unix pathname style,
e.g. leadtek/winfast6300 specifies a leadtek winfast6300 board. The
tool then looks in the directory
$(TOP)/src/mainboard/leadtek/winfast6300 for a Config file, and
processes that file. In the course of processing a Config file, the
tool may encounter other commands that lead to other Config files.
For example, for the northbridge, there will be a Config file; for the cpu
type there will be a Config file, and so on. 

As of 12/7/2000, the config tool has the following directives:
target		 Specify the target directory for builds. 
		 This directory must exist -- sorry, we're being cautious
		 for now
mainboard	 Specify the mainboard vendor and name in Unix pathname
		 format, e.g. leadtek/winfast6300 means the leadtek 
		 winfast6300 board
cpu		 Specify the cpu, e.g. cpu p6
northbridge	 Specify the northbridge vendor and name, e.g. via/vt8601
southbridge	 Specify the southbridge vendor and name, e.g. via/vt826c686a
northsouthbridge For combined north and south bridge parts, specify 
		 them as one, e.g. sis/630
pcibridge	 This has not been used yet, but it is for pcibridges, 
		 which are NOT the same as the other bridges
superio		 Specify the superio, e.g. winbond/w83977ef
object		 Add an object to the set of objects, e.g. object keyboard.o
raminit		 Add a .S file to the list of files used for ram init. 
		 The path is rooted at $(TOP)/src
		 e.g. you might have:
		 raminit sdram/generic_sdram.inc
		 raminit northbridge/intel/440gx/raminitspd.inc
docipl		 Specify the code to use and generate rules for building 
		 a docipl, e.g. docipl northsouthbridge/sis/630/ipl.S
linux		 Name the path for the linux binary, e.g. linux /usr/src/linux
keyboard	 Name the keyboard, e.g. keyboard pc80/keyboard.c
makerule	 Specify an additional makerule, e.g. 
		 makerule LINUX=../../linux/vmlinux
		 (note that this is an unused usage, since we have the 
		  linux command)
commandline	  Specify the command line, e.g.
		  commandline root=/dev/hda1 single
option		  Add an option, implicitly setting it. 
		  e.g. option SERIAL_CONSOLE
