spatches are the semantic patches
tmp is just tmp
inputs are copied from $LINUX
per-file-changes contain input files that have specific transforms
final contains the final form of the file, with 'global' changes applied (e.g. kzalloc -> calloc)

transform copies files from $LINUX and then transforms them for use by stand-alone program/coreboot

The Makefile is simple; this runs 'fast enough' that a complicated Makefile is not worth it.

There's still some duct tape here but it's getting there.
