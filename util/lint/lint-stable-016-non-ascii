# 1. Get the list of files to parse and send them through grep
# 2. Find any characters that aren't TAB, or space (0x20) to ~ (0x7F)
#    LF (0x10) isn't included, as it ends the grep line
# 3. Remove common phrases and names that have been found
# 4. Run the result through grep again to highlight the issues that were
#    found.  Without this step, the characters can be difficult to see.
