Summary of Operation
--------------------
nvramtool is a utility for reading/writing coreboot parameters and
displaying information from the coreboot table.  It is intended for x86-based
systems (both 32-bit and 64-bit) that use coreboot.

The coreboot table resides in low physical memory, and may be accessed
through the /dev/mem interface.  It is created at boot time by coreboot, and
contains various system information such as the type of mainboard in use.  It
specifies locations in the CMOS (nonvolatile RAM) where the coreboot
parameters are stored.

For information about coreboot, see http://www.coreboot.org/.

Ideas for Future Improvements
-----------------------------
1.  Move the core functionality of this program into a shared library.
2.  Consider adding options for displaying other BIOS-provided information
    such as the MP table, ACPI table, PCI IRQ routing table, etc.
