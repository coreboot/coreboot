 * and Z is bits 7..4 of the device revision register. We do not match
 * bits 3..0 of the device revision here (at least for newer Super I/Os).
 *
 * But some of the older versions use both bytes (0x20 and 0x21), where
 * register 0x21 holds the ID and the full 8 bits of 0x21 hold the revision.
 *
 * Some other Super I/Os only use bits 3..0 of 0x09 as ID.
