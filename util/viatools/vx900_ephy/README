On the VX900 chipset, the SATA physical layer is controllable by index/value
pairs in the PCI config space. Getting the EPHY config (as VIA calls it) is thus
not achievable by a simple lspci -xx.

The EPHY config is needed to get the SATA links running properly. The default
values disable the driving resistors. While the SATA link may appear to work
initially, the chipset indicates a PHY error occurs. This tool reads the EPHY
config from a VX900 chipset.
